Lola comes with a couple of useful scripts.


compile :
----------

 Syntax : compile (no arguments)

Compile installs the mud in such a way that you can start running the mud
right after compile is finished.


down :
-------

syntax : down (no arguments)

down shuts the mud down, by sending the called scripts and the running binary
the SIGTERM signal.


lola.csh :
-------

syntax : lola.csh [-h]
	 lola.csh [-p <port#>] [-areadebug <level>] [-nosocket] [-n] [-count]

lola.csh starts the mud. Except with the -h parameter.
Here comes the meaning of the flags:
-h                 : shows the syntaxes described above
-p <port#>         : This defines the port on which lola will run, it defaults to
                     4321. If you define another port this way, the mud will run
                     as a testsite
-areadebug <level> : The mud can give lots of info while booting and loading
                     the areas. With this option you can check wether or not
                     there are problems with an area. Possible level values
                     are 1 - 5.
-nosocket          : On some systems the mud would give heaps of SO_ERROR
                     messages, this suppresses them.
-n                 : Don't show the log to the screen. This is very handy
                     when you use nohup to run the mud, or your nohup.out
                     will grow, with double info, since this info is in the
                     normal logs already!
-count             : a nice addition, counting how many areas, mobs, rooms
                     and objects are in the running.

findip :
---------

syntax : findip <ip-address>

findip quickly searches all the playerfiles for the given IP address. So if
you found out that someone behaved really nasty, eg. made the mud crash, you
can search for his/her IP address. That persons characters are found, by IP
address. All the playernames are stored in badass.txt

down :
-------

syntax : down [-lola] [-tail] [-current_lola]

'down' is used to kill the processes that are used by the mud. While the
flags exists, they have become deprecated. You better use only 'down' with
no arguments, so only the processes that are attached to the location where
you are running the mud are being shut off. It also removed the files
lola.pid, script.pid and RUNNING


backup :
---------

syntax : backup [-h] [[-player] [-area] [-clan] [-doc] [-src]]

backup is going to be the replacement for 'tarball'. The idea with backup
is that you can choose which part you want to backup instead of the whole.
If you don't use any argument with backup, backup will assume you choose all
the arguments (except for -h), for the -h is not used in combination with
any other argument. It doesn't matter in which order you give the arguments,
though the order of execution is fixed. Backup is quite powerfull, though I
still have to get used to the quirks of 'tcsh'. Backup calls another new
script : clean_src...


startup :
----------
(no arguments)

starts lola in one word :) Essentially it only does:

nohup lola.csh -nosocket -n >/dev/null&


install :
----------
(no arguments)

I know you're lazy, just as I am... You only have to run this script once,
when you've just unpacked the tarball that is lola (lola-<version>.tar)
it will install everything you need.


mkpackage :
------------
(no arguments)

Makes a tarfile from your backups.


un-install :
-------------
destroys all files (except the backups) associated with lola, for if you
wish to re-install everything.
