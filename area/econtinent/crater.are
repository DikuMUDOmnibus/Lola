{308}
As I was wandering the holy grove one day, seeking out a druid to help with
a nasty dwarven toe fungus that had been maligning me, I stumbled into a
strange void.  When I emerged, I found myself near Thalos, except it wasn't
the sere desecrated ruins that we know as Thalos, but a verdant, lush Thalos,
full of wonder and spectacle.  Surely this was the Thalos of the past, but
how?

As I explored the perimeter of the great city, I came across a crossroads.
I turned north, smelling an acrid odor from that direction, only to find
myself at the bank of a midnight-black stream, cutting across a place where
all the trees had been burned to the ground.  Across the stream and to the
north sprouted a huge crater, roughly 400 horseheads into the sky, the trees
blown down all around it in a radial pattern.  The light was growing dim,
and the stream ran deep, so I was forced to turn back, but I hope that I 
will one day have a chance to explore this strange and wonderful place.

I have heard stories of gemstones and minerals being harvested from just such
craters near the dwarven kingdom.

A crater kobold wanders the crater floor with his pick.~
The crater kobold is quite furry and reeks of carrion.  Although
not known as a mining race, the opportunities presented by this
location were obviously too much for the kobolds to pass up.

the crater shaman~
The crater shaman stands here with a contented smile on his face.~
While the kobold race in general is organized into various ranks determined
by military necessity, relegating religion to a minor role, something has
happened to this particular band to turn their superstitions into a way of
life.  The kobold shaman is a product of that transformation, and he wears
the garb of someone of great importance.

The Small River~
You find yourself on a narrow but swiftly flowing river which has been
partially blocked off upstream by some sort of landslide.  The rapids
downstream aren't navigable.  A rough path leads off to the north, where
there seems to be some sort of barking, though it's hard to make it out.

You're trudging along a rough path which has been ground into dark
volcanic tuff.  The path is narrow and faint, but it seems to lead up the
steep ridge which lies to the north.  The countryside is strangely devoid
of all vegetation, and you get the feeling that something cataclysmic has
occurred here not long ago.  The path also leads off to the south.

You find yourself gasping for air after your short, steep scramble.  You now

depression of some sort which dominates the landscape to the north.  It
would be difficult to climb down into the basin from here, but you might
be able to skirt the crater to the east or north and find an easier way down.

As you round a boulder, you spot a small campsite with a fire circle and
straw pallet which has been slept on.  Someone has dragged a wooden
table up on top of this rocky ridge, and the pile of supplies under a rock to
your left indicates that the larder is well stocked and continually resupplied.
There is a lake to the south, presumably created by the landslide you
saw earlier, but a thick cover of algae and an intense odor keep you away.

In the Tube~
You've dropped into another smooth-walled tube, though this one
has no mist to clutter your vision or clog your lungs.  You can head
either west or east from here, both of which lead down into both
heat and darkness.  You cannot, however, head back up the way you
came down.

In the Tube~
You're standing at a dead end in a smooth-walled tube, though something
about the far wall seems a little strange.  The color is... hey, the wall is
made not of glassy rock, but of water which shines silvery in the dim light
of this room.  There appears to be a membrane of some sort which holds
back the water, but as you gently slip your hand through the membrane,
it becomes clear that you should have no trouble passing through in this
direction.  But into what?

You've entered a large chamber whose west wall has a scaly, yet moist,
texture, unlike any of the other walls you've encountered in this maze
of smooth-walled tubes.  As you reach out to touch it, suddenly you

A Small Chamber~
You've managed to squeeze beneath the hulking body of the gargolith,
where there is a small chamber which contains what looks like mainly
dead skin from that huge beast.

The Nasty Lake~
You slide carefully through the membrane, holding your breath in
anticipation of what lies on the other side.

Glub!

Suddenly you find yourself entangled in thick, foul-smelling algae.
You scramble for shore as quickly as you can, quicker even.  You
almost preferred the tubes to this....

The Geyser~
The steam released by your sharp pick has ripped a jagged hole through
the volcanic tuff and obsidian above and below you.  Unlike the smooth
tunnels carved by the tenticles, you find abundant handholds suitable
for climbing into the hole above your head, or safely descending into
the rumbling abyss below your feet.  You spy two hollows with smooth
walls to the north and west bearing tenticle marks.  You would
be well-advised to make your explorations hasty, as it is uncertain
just how long it will take before the geyser repressurizes and
blows again...

The Geyser~
As you descend into the geyser hole, you find that your handholds of
volcanic tuff have been replaced with solid bedrock granite.  The crack
below you has irissed itself down so tight that even the smallest
pixie would be unable to squeeze inside it.  You can see now that the
gargolith has left its imprint on these walls, carving smooth rooms
in four directions to safely harbor its young within this hellish world
of geothermal heat and steam.

The Geyser~
You have managed to scramble your way up through the volcanic tough
into a small room where presumably a deposit of soluble rock has been
eroded away by the hot steam from below.  The roof of this room is
solid obsidian glass, much harder than the surrounding volcanic tuff,
which has been carved by both gargolith tenticle and steam alike into
a myriad of passageways and rooms.  The geyser hole continues west and
down.

The Geyser~
The steam from the earth below has found a small seam in the obsidian
glass above your head, carving a small hole which you'd be hard-pressed
to squeeze yourself into, so to speak.  A hint of sunlight from above
lights the acrid air, and you have a sudden yet impractical urge to
claw your way through the solid rock to freedom and fresh air.  All
around you are the marks of the gargolith, who has carved wide rooms
in the volcanic tuff to house its young, oddly secure in this hostile
environment.
