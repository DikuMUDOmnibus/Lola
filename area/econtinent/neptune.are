{128}                              Neptune's Garden
{308}
In my travels about the great eastern continent, I have encountered
more than one society which embraces a theology centered around the
ocean god Neptune.  Those that inhabit the region around Mt. Olympus
say that there are gods who live high above the clouds on that peak,
and these gods include Neptune and his siblings.  Piscyrean refugees
live a spartan life of devotion to this ocean lord, and the marvelous
undersea city of Atlantis bears the marks of both Neptune's mentorship
and his wrath.  Having infiltrated Atlantis and befriended a few of
its citizens in hopes of finding a home for my clan and forging a lasting
relationship therein, I found myself with a unique opportunity to
delve into the culture and beliefs of those whose lives depend entirely
on the sea.  Their fears have not been lost on me, and I've grown to
accept many of their chronicles as truth.  One intrepid explorer named
Ysortus writes:

"While mapping out the sea floor outside the dome, my party stumbled
upon a deep rift in the earth, which extended as far above and below
us as the instruments could detect.  Further exploration led to an
encounter with one of His Holiness' minions, and only I was left as
my party turned and fled from whence we came.  I, too, turned my tail
after the minion spoke of a mortal audience with our Maker, the idea
of which is too terrible to imagine.  We shan't venture into the Abyss
again."

I am currently assembling a strong party to explore this forsaken realm
deep in the Abyss, though I doubt that any mortal could penetrate very
far, confronted with the prospect of encountering a vengeful God..

A Hole in the Darkness~
The blackness of the abyss wraps you in a cold, empty cacoon.  You can see
only darkness in every direction, though you can feel that the walls of the
abyss have closed in all around you, forming a small alcove.  As you bring
your lantern close to the wall for inspection, you notice a strange rock to
your left, and an indentation to your right.

You have made it to a wall in this seemingless endless expanse of
oily black water, deep within the heart of the abyss.  The rock of
the wall is smooth to the touch, except for a series of orderly

The path to Lord Neptune is a long and arduous one.  His Greatness
is easily annoyed by distraction and has created a series of tests
to both discourage frivolous requests and to provide entertainment
for the courtiers of his godly palace.  If you must call on His
Greatness, then say 'enter' when you are ready to proceed.

You find yourself in a large cavern, shrouded in darkness in all directions.
It is difficult to tell even which way is up, and the ringing in your ears

and a spiral stair in the middle of the room leads to what appears to be an

source of which seems to lie beyond the flickering walls.  Escape from
the pits is impossible, though, because despite the ephemeral nature of
the shimmering, dancing walls, they are quite solid to the touch, and so
smooth that they cannot be climbed.  It must be time to face the challenge,

deep within.  It is a garden in the sense that it resembles what a garden
might look like if it were entirely submerged in seawater, but this does
not lessen its beauty in any way.  Colorful anenomes wave their tentacles
at you, while striped fish dart in and out of fragile sponges.
Uniquely-shaped rocks have been placed in attractive patterns between the
natural-looking but well-planned rows of cultivated sea cucumbers and
crinoid fans.  You see that you are standing in a small enclosure at the
very center of the garden, which you can now see stretches to the horizon
in every direction.  Beyond the garden rise the towering turrets and
ramparts of a great castle which shines turquoise and glows brighter than
anything you have yet witnessed in your abyssal explorations.  It appears
that you may have to be happy viewing the castle from afar, as visitors
seem to be corralled toward a large daythrone just to your left.

shares this small part of his glorious kingdom with the few lucky souls
who survive the rite of passage he has created for them.  Perhaps he is

At the Beginning of the Abyss~
Your ears pop as you head down into the cold, murky depths.  Only darkness
greets you below, and you can't help but wonder how far down you'll have to
dive before you hit bottom...

You spot a brightly colored fish sporting a unique collection of scales
which form a message.
