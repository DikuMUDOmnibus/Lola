A rocky path~
The path here follows the floor of a narrow ravine and is roughly paved with
rocks which have been worn smooth from the tread of countless travellers. Two
faint wagon wheel tracks have been worn into the rock over the centuries. To the
south you can see a large gate built between the ravine walls.

This barren wasteland has clearly been the site of some great battle of
yesteryear. The ground is littered with scraps of rusting armour and mouldy
leather, as well as the odd unidentifiable piece of organic matter. A few
scraggly trees and rocky outcrops dot the landscape and you occasionally glimpse
what appear to be bones poking up through the mud.  The area is strangely silent
aside from the whistling of the wind.

A barren wasteland~
This barren wasteland has clearly been the site of some great battle of
yesteryear. The ground is littered with scraps of rusting armour and mouldy
leather, as well as the odd unidentifiable piece of organic matter. A few
scraggly trees and rocky outcrops dot the landscape and you occasionally glimpse
what appear to be bones poking up through the mud.  The area is strangely silent
aside from the whistling of the wind.

A barren wasteland~
This barren wasteland has clearly been the site of some great battle of
yesteryear. The ground is littered with scraps of rusting armour and mouldy
leather, as well as the odd unidentifiable piece of organic matter. A few
scraggly trees and rocky outcrops dot the landscape and you occasionally glimpse
what appear to be bones poking up through the mud.  The area is strangely silent
aside from the whistling of the wind.

A camp in the pass~
This pass through the hills is filled with what appears to be a military camp.
You see a few tents and cook fires in neat orderly lines. To the east the pass
narrows to a mere few yards where a silver gate has been built blocking the way,
while to the west you see a movable barricade of stakes and fences. The wind
here is quite powerful as it rushes through the pass.
