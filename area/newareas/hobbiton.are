{120}                                  Hobbiton
{070}
Hobbiton may seem like a peaceful village, but excitement and intrigue lurk
beneath its placid surface.  Some inhabitants might be shy and may need your
coaxing to get them to tell you how you can be of help.  Others are difficult to
shut up!  One thing is for certain:  don't ever take anything at face value.

The river peacefully flows, and a large fish leaps from the water, making a
crystalline arch before plopping heavily back in.  There is a soft, low murmur
of honeybees in the flowers on the bank.

depths.

Old Forest~
There is an indescribable feeling of being watched here and with each snap and
crack of twigs the feeling grows more palpable.  The entrance from the high hay
seems far away now and the path here difficult to follow.

Old Forest~
Trees surround you, in all shapes and sizes.  Some are gnarled and bent, others
grow straight to the clouds.  Shaggy moss hangs from their branches, and the
roots growing up through the ground appear almost like the skeletal remains of a
long forgotten creature.

Old Forest~
The trees here are taller, darker and stand more closely together.  An ominous
feeling hangs in the air, thicker than smoke, and the light is dim, the colour
of dark green velvet.  The path almost seems to shift direction.

Old Forest~
This is indeed a forest primieval.  The trees, twisted or straight, appear to
have been here since before creation.  Their skin hangs on them, grey and
covered in moss, leaves not moving, but flutter down to the damp earth as if
somehow being shed.  The path is faint and hard to follow.

River Withywindle~
The river wends it's way lazily along.  The air here is cool and damp, and a
sudden flapping of wings overahead makes you gasp in surprise.  Graceful swans
swim along the river, their feathers a velvety black.
