Collegium Commons~
Contained within this small area are several shops, their windows clean and
shining, soft white curtains fluttering in the breeze.  There is also a
wonderful aroma of food in the air, and some raucous laughter comes from yet
another building.

In the Commons~
Students gather in this popular area, chatting in groups of two and three,
precious bound books held protectively in their arms.  The doors to the shops
are open, and to the south is a well loved tavern, famous for its hearty meals
and strong ale.

The Black Swan~
The tavern is full of noise and the smell of good food.  Large oak tables, well
used but scrubbed clean, fill the room, their benches filled with students and
professors alike.  A long bar dominates the room, its surface shining softly of
countless applications of beeswax.  A few sleeping rooms are upstairs, for those
who have studied into the small hours of the night.

Hallway~
The hallway is much broader than the stairway, and there are two sets of living
quarters here.  Several Collegium students live in each of the quarters,
although not all students live on the grounds.  A deep indigo blue carpet runs
down the hallway, keeping it quiet for those students who might be catching up
on sleep.
