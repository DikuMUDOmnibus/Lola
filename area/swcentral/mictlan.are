Mictlan Region was supposedly named after a great elementalist, Mictlan.
It is said that he has travel around the world learning and gathering many
potent magical items. At the end of his journey, he found himself deep within
a jungle. It is said that their he built his home. Many have tried to find this
magical place to learn all that Mictlan has learned, but every mission into
the jungle has ended in failure. But this is all just rumors, since no one has
ever found this place or is it?

Water Elemental Statue~
As you step into the room, you notice a statue depicting a water elemental, as
far as you can make it out. Looking carefully at the statue, you see a sign
on its hand. After reading it, you found out that this is the beginning to the
test of earth elements.

You are standing in a underwater cavern. The water here seems to be very calm.
You can't tell which way the water flows. Also you notice that there aren't
any sea creatures around, maybe that's a good sign. Be sure you have enough
oxygen to last. You don't want to drown down here.
