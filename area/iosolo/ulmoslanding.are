{138}                                Order's Landing
{300}
Order's Landing achieved fame some decades ago as the gateway to the Martherian
Archipelago. As the great seafaring nation of Martherius prospered, so did
Order's Landing.

With the appearance recently of a mighty whirlpool off the shores of Order's
Landing, all contact with Martherius has ground to a halt. The whirlpool has
come to be known as the Maelstrom or 'Doom of Ships'. Order's Landing is now a
sleepy village, with few visitors bar a few diehard pilgrims and travelling
tradesmen. The occasional Martherian captain still makes the perilous journey
past the Maelstrom, but no mainland vessel has ever survived the journey.

{300}
There is one major quest in this area, consisting of three distinct stages. The
first stage results in a mid-level weapon, the second stage results in some
mid-level damage equipment, while the final stage results in better mid- to
high-level damage equipment. You will have to keep your eyes open and pay
attention to what the residents get up to to finish it, so be warned.

There is also one long-ish scavenger-hunt style quest for a decent mid- to
high-level light. You will also need this light later ;)

There is one short scavenger-hunt style quest for a mid-level weapon.

There are also several miniquests dotted around this area.

1. In addition to my preference of having examinable objects in room
descriptions, in this area I have tried hard to introduce an element of 'life'
to the mobiles. What this means in game terms is that they don't stand in one
room 24 hours a day :P Hopefully it is effective and adds some realism to the
area. It may be a little irritating at certain points in the quest though ;)

2. Hopefully I have lived up to my promise in the Dreamwood help file and made
my quests a bit more complex! If any part of them strikes you as being
particularly obscure feel free to suggest any improvements.

3. This area is designed to have some leveling potential for resourceful
mid-level characters, however there are complications ...
