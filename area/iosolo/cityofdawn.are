0 "DAWN CITY"~
{120}                       Dawn City
{300}
Dawn city is located in the southern region of Iosolo it is one of the largest
cities in that region.  The city is made up of mostly an elven population that
pay homage to their god Order. The people there are peaceful and enjoy a strong
love of nature and its surroundings.  The city has fallen on dark times and is
in the need of heroes to help in its fight against evil.  The city borders the
North Woods, a strange and magical place that few have ever visited.  Dawn City
lies quite remote from the battles to the east with Lessiah City, so the people
there don't feel many affects of the war, but they have their own troubles and
perhaps you can help them.

0 DAWNCITY1~
There are several quests in dawn city including the major one that aids the
people of the city against evil.  Most of these quests require 95th level
characters and the more reincarnations the better.  They take patience,
cunning, and raw strength at times.  They should be entertaining so good luck.
It should also be noted that the quests in the North Woods and Dawn City are
multiple area quests so the quests will take one to both areas quite often.
~

0 DAWNCITY2~
There are many rewards that can be obtained in Dawn City and the North Woods
the rewards are combined just as the quests are.  There are several items
mostly for large reincarnate to be found in the major quests.  The most
sought after one perhaps is the shield of the ancients a relic that Order
himself once used in battle along with many of his avatars.
~

0 DAWNCITY3~
Dawn City and the North Woods are for very advanced players I would not
recommend bringing newer players here unless they are a very advanced
group of players.  I would also recommend bringing only reincarnated
characters into the areas for there is much danger there.

On a Pond~
You on a dark blue pond.  The water is clear when you look into it, but has
a dark blue color when you look at it from a distance.  The pond seems to have
a massive bounty of fish swimming in it.  You can see them jumping out of the
water on occasion causing a small splash.  The water here looks much deeper
than the rest of the pond you have seen so far.

Damp Cave~
You find yourself in a damp cave.  The cave is covered in strange fungus and
has strange rock formations covering most of the cave.  It seems to be a dead
end here and the only way out is to swim back down into the tunnel.  This cave
is serving as an air pocket and you can breath freely as you rest here.  You
notice a crack on the northern cave wall.

Treetop Lookout~
You are standing on a platform on a large elm tree.  This platform serves as
a lookout post for the elven sentries that guard the city.  There are a few
overhanging branches that serve as make-shift benches here where one could
take a rest.  You can see the entire trail to the east from here and you can
see over the wooden city walls to the west.

Dark Cave~
You are in a small, dark cave.  The cave is quite small more like a small jail
cell.  There are a few rocks jutting from the ground but other than that
there are few details.
