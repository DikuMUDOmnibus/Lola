{128}                              ELLIS CITY

{308}Ellis City is a large city on the island country of Iosolo.  The city is the
capital of this island country.  The land is full of beauty, magic, and great
evils as well.  The land is constantly living in fear of a great evil force that
lies to its eastern borders in Lessiah City.  Though many great warriors have
battled the evil to keep the great walled city safe from attacks.  The city's
leader, King Ellis is a good and just king that all the citizens respect and
adore, has always tried to keep the peace in the lands.  But times of late have
fallen back into war...

{128}                                Quests

{308}There are several quests within Ellis City.  They are not too difficult but some
can be a bit time consuming.  There should be ample information about completing
each quest in the area.  Some of the fights may be a bit challenging so I would
recommend large groups of high level characters to complete some parts of the
quests.  There is one large creature that lives in Ellis City that has chances
to give great rewards, but he is more powerful than most creatures in the
realms, so be cautious adventurers...

{128}                                Rewards

{308}The rewards one will receive from each quest can be different each time some
quests are done so you may want to retry the quests with different characters to
see what you get as a reward.  Most of the rewards are quite powerful and are
equipment of all types (Damage, Mana, Armor Class, Levelling Equipment).  So be
patient and have fun.

{128}                             Creator's Notes

{308}I had a lot of fun creating this area.  It is my first area so I hope
everyone enjoys exploring it and trying the quests.  I hope there are not to
many bugs in it, but time will tell :).  I hope to add more areas around the
country of Iosolo and perhaps a much larger multiarea quest someday.

Enjoy,

Oren

There are a few that will help us though.  Seek out Drell in the shadows he and tell him i need help he will help us for sure.

      say A wise old man gave me this token many, many years ago my friend. He was a great wizard of this land and a savior to its people.  No one knew his name or where he came from originally, but we all knew he had great power.  He came on a ship from the west when times were bad...
      mpecho {078}LoffLoff grins and looks to the sky...
    endif
    if quest (0,8,$i) == 2
      say Yes, sad times for all of Iosolo back then, for you see we were plagued by a great evil.  The evil arrived one dark day and it changed all our lives...  The land once was one a haven of safety and peace, but that all changed the day the great red dragon Tanc appeared from the east.  He was brought here by the great evil being, that we all called "The Evil One"...
      mpecho {078}LoffLoff takes a puff from his pipe.
    endif
    if quest (0,8,$i) == 3
      say For years we lived in fear of the dragon and his minions as they ravaged the countryside.  Thousands of lives were lost before we knew it.  The king assembled his best armies but they could only slow the inevidetable...
    endif
    if quest (0,8,$i) == 4
      say Until the dark stranger began to take action!
      grin 
      say He banded together several of the best warriors in the land to embark on a great journey to banish Tanc from Iosolo.  The wizard created a magical seal that could contain the dragon in a magical prison preventing him from entering the eastern lands and reeking more havoc.
      mpecho {078}LoffLoff pauses and takes a puff off his pipe.
    endif
    if quest (0,8,$i) == 5
      say The group of seven men travelled east to the ruins of Lessiah City where Tanc had made his haven.  They fought their way through his minions and were able to trap the dragon in the magical seal and stripping his power.  Without their leader the minions of their leader ran and hid in the underworld while the troops of Ellis City were able to overrun them...
      mpecho {078}LoffLoff blows a smoke ring out...
    endif
    if quest (0,8,$i) == 6
      say The seven men were known as the knights of the seal for that day forward and after that day the strange wizard was never seen again.  Most of the knights passed away as time went on except for a few that seemed to cheat death. No one ever saw the wizard again, he existed only in folk lore and tavern tales. But I saw him...
      smile 
    endif
    if quest (0,8,$i) == 7
      say Late that night when I was a young lad I saw the wizard as he was leaving town he looked down at me and flipped me this token and told me it would give me luck.  It has ever since.
      mpecho {078}LoffLoff takes another puff from his pipe...
    endif
    if quest (0,8,$i) == 8
      say Well, I let my brother use it for luck when they first started flying that silly airship to the main continent.  We've started to get a lot of new visitors since that airship has come here.  But I guess he found he didn't need the coin anymore so I thank you for returning it.  Now I think I will need the luck more than ever.  If you have not heard yet $t, we are at war again...
      sigh 
    endif
    if quest (0,8,$i) == 9
      say It seems the magical seal has been weakened by a group of evil men that wish to put Tanc back into power again and to destroy Ellis City.  So access to the city will be limited to strangers like yourself I would think.
      mpecho {078}LoffLoff takes another puff from his pipe...
    endif
    if quest (0,8,$i) == 10
      say There is hope though since the seal has not been completely broken.  Tanc only has limited power over his minions and a group of great warriors has been sent to repair the broken seal.  But there is much work to do and I know the king can use as much help as possible from strong adventurers like you.

The first of the warriors we must recruit is Manfred.  He was once a great ranger of the woods to the north, but has fallen on sad times.  Seek him out and recruit him for our cause.

I would bring a lot of your friends to help you against Kaz and his minions because it could be very dangerous and we only have one shot at this...

{128}                                  Iosolo's Wars
{308}
Iosolo has always been at war with enemies from Lessiah City, for the past 500
years.  Lessiah City was once a prosperous city but was taken over by an evil
force, known as "The Evil One" this evil force left an evil red dragon named
Tanc to oversee his doings.  The city has raided all of the Iosolo countryside
and attacked Ellis City many times.  They have killed thousands and destroyed
villages but the people of Iosolo always rebuilt.

The horror went on for years until one day, about 50 years ago, when a strange
robed man set foot upon the gates of Ellis City.  He formed a band of warriors
and they went into a hidden cave in the Horned Mountains and created a magical
seal that would seal Tanc and his power of his minions within the city limits
of Lessiah City.  After his minions were detached from their leader the armies
of Ellis City were able to fight off the remaining evil forces.  Shortly after
the unknown man was never seen again...

From that day on Ellis City has lived in peace and harmony.  Some have tried to
destroy the seal but have all failed in vain.  The seal remains strong to this
day.

                                Ellis City's History
{308}
Ellis City was founded nearly 300 years ago and has been the capital city of
Iosolo for that time as well.  Lord Ellis and his dog named Iosolo explored this
island many hears ago and created a small outpost and he named the country after
his dog Iosolo.

Ellis City began as an outpost but grew into one of the larger cities in all the
realms.  Geographically it lies between a fork of the Hallowed river, making a
good defensive position for the city against its enemies.  The city started off
as a fishing community and grew into a major trading haven for merchants all
over Iosolo.

The city is the home of the royal family, or currently King Ellis the last
remaining person of the royal family.  The king's sons died in the battles
against Tanc and his wife died from disease.  With no heir there is turmoil of
who will claim the throne after the death of the mighty king.  Rumors of city
councellors squabbling over the royal positions fly throughout the city.

The city has seen many battles in its day but its mighty walls have shunned all
attackers.  The military is headed up by General Storm a mighty general who has
fought more battles than most can count.  The military headquarters for the
country is located in Ellis City as well as the Ivory Spire the home of the
king.  Ellis City has faced many set backs in its years but has always endured
and shall forever...

The North Woods, are geographically located in the southern part of Iosolo,
are a strange magical forest.  Few dare to enter these woods because of the
legends they have heard.  The woods are home to strange and mysterious
creatures few have seen.  Most that enter the woods never return.  One of
the king's great mages Yoca entered the woods years ago and has never been
heard from since.  There are also rumors of a strange tree city that lies
deep in these woods.

The Behemoth is an ancient beast though few have ever seen it.  The beast is
legended to sleep deep beneath Ellis City and awaken once every ten years to
ravage the land and eat its fill only then to fall back into its hibernation
once again for years.  Some have tried to find the beast in tunnels under
the city but none have returned.  The belly of this beast is rumored to hold
great treasures if one was to kill the mighty beast.
