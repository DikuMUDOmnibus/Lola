{120}                       North Woods

{300}The North woods is a magical wooded area that has been told in
legends and lore around Iosolo for years.  Little is known about
the woods except that it once existed in the northern parts of
Iosolo near Ellis City but some how it was magically moved near
Dawn City to the south.  Many have adventured to the woods but
few ever returned with their tales.  Much danger and adventure
surely lie within these mysterious woods, does one have the
courage to venture there.

      say There was a magical implosion back in the old city which caused a rift in time and caused many distortions.  So we are in a magical forest that is sort of floating in limbo.
      cackle 
    case 6
      say The unfortunate side effect of the implosion is that most of the citizens of the city, ceased to exist, while others became ethereal beings that eternally live in these woods.
    case 7
      say Other things happened as well like, some of the old citizens of the city became these horrible beasts that rampage through the woods killing anything they see.
    case 8
      say Another strange side effect from the implosion was that the temple of oaks that used to reside west of the city was sucked into the woods and now resides in here, making it hard for the priests and priestesses to access the temple.
    case 9
      say Many adventurers and scholars have come here trying to solve the puzzle of the North Woods but most fail and mainly with their lives, since there is no way out of the woods, without godly powers of transportation.
    case 10
      say So the woods are not really an illusion more of an alter reality...

The City of Elm was once one of the most prosperous cities in Iosolo which
lied in the North Woods near Ellis City.  The city of mostly elves lived
very peacefully in harmony until the presence of the evil mage and his
fiends.

The Great Temple of Oaks was taken over and the Orbs scattered about the
region.  Legends say they are close by to Dawn City.  After a great magical
mishap the city was all be destroyed.  There were few survivors most of whom
were transformed into beasts that haunt the woods to this day.  Some Legends
say the High Elder of Elm, the Archmage Adlian still exists in the woods.

The North Woods were geographically exist in the southern part of Iosolo
since the implosion in the City of Elm.  Since then the woods have been a
place of magic and mystery.  Within the woods holds a place of great power,
The Temple of Oaks, where the 3 orbs hold together the balance of reality and
dreams.  It is said that only those that our close to the Earth and Nature
can truely find passage to the temple.

The orbs have been scattered about the region and if they remain away from
the temple then the fabric of all that is known to be real is in jeopardy in
Dawn City and its surrounding areas.

Many beasts roam the area which are assumed to be the haunted souls of the
former residents of Elm.  They are very dangerous and have known to kill many
visitors of the woods.  There are said to be scarabs that will ward off the
beasts with the markings of cdnalya vl.  Which is ancient elvish for protect me.
The woods themselves seem to shift and almost shift about as you walk
through the maze of paths, making it nearly impossible to leave.  Strange
things have been known to happen in the woods, but most who enter never
leave alive...
~
E
iii~
The Temple of Oaks was once a sacred place where the citizens of Elm and
Dawn City once worshipped Order in peace and harmony.  When the temple was
defiled a great darkness and presence of evil befell the land.  The temple
once was the home of three great orbs.  These relics have great powers and
kept a peaceful balance in the woods and cities nearby.  During the dark
times an evil presence has taken over the temple and dispersed the orbs
far from the temple.  Legend says the only way to rid this evil is to return
the orbs to temple on their altars' and dispatch any evil within...

There is said to have several doorways that must be passed before one can
reach the inner sanctum, little detail is known however of these doorways,
but it is very dangerous and those only of great valor have been known to
journey there.

The center of the temple has 3 altars where the orbs are usually placed.  The
ruby orb is placed on the altar of pain, the emerald orb is placed on the
altar of deceit, and the sapphire orb is placed on the altar of stasis.  Then
and only then can one enter through the gateway of truth.

One must look at the symbol on each orb then say the name of the symbol in
ancient elvish to relink each orb to the appropriate altar, so is told in
books of lore...
