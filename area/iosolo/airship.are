{128}                                Airship
{308}
The airship is a fun little ship that will help you travel from here to there.
There are several locations the airship departs from.  Sun Dome, Ellis City,
Piscyra, and the Gnome Empire.  Take a ride when you get a chance.  The
airship is run mainly by drunken gnomes so be patient with the crew!

You find yourself on a massive galleon, although at second glance you realize
it's not a galleon at all, but an airship!  It sails lazily through the air,
using a massive red balloon full of magic gas mounted onto it by strong ropes
and harnesses.  This ship makes long flights, so make yourself at home and enjoy
the ride!

This room is the storage room that contains ship supplies.  There are many
coils of rope and lengths of chain in a pile in the corner.  Several
barrels are stacked on the other side of the room.  There are some peculiar
looking containers near the end wall with some weird inscriptions on them.

Magic Gas Making Room~
You have uncovered the secret laboratory of Dr. Winklestaff, the genius that
invented the magical gas that allows the airship to float in the air.  You
see a table set up with lots of high-tech instruments, vials, beakers, and
containers full of special chemicals and ingredients.  The doctor himself
is here mixing a brew of the gas as we speak.  There are a few tanks
in the corner of the lab.

Crow's Nest~
You climb the ladder to find yourself in the ship's crow's nest.  Its
not like an ordinary ocean vessel's crow's nest because you are at
the very rear of the ship.  You can see for miles from this spot, there are
several birds hovering nearby making alot of noise.
