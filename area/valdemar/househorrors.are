{120}                              House of Horrors
{300}
Stories tell of an old haunted house somewhere along the ancient roads.
Many great magical armors can be found there, for those worthy enough to
retrieve it.  Whether these rumors are true or not, is not known.  Those who
have ventured forth to seek this haunted house have never returned to tell
their story.  Perhaps you can succeed where others have failed.

The bell tower.~
This room has a magnificent view of the surrounding countryside. There is a
large bell hanging from the roof and the walls are open to the outside. A
walkway runs around the bell on the inside of a small wall, presumably there to
prevent one from falling down out of the tower.

The attic here is dusty. It has probably been a while since anyone has been
here. There are various family-type things lying around: there is a teddybear
and a doll's pram. You wonder why people bother keeping all their old stuff.

doubt whether it is still operational.

You are in a room that is most definitely never going to win any prizes for

than that, it serves very little purpose. It is not a nice passageway - there
is a nasty draft wafting through the room and it is has a rather unfriendly
colour - dull, uninviting grey. The passageway comes to an end here at a door

The pantry.~
This part of the pantry is much like any other pantry, except for the contents
of the shelves. Dismembered body parts are contained in glass jars and you feel
a little uneasy about all the body-less eyes that seem to be staring out at
you. There is a large pile of mouldy cheese to the one side and a small forest
of little mushrooms growing in a dark corner. Your appetite vanishes. There is
yet another spiral staircase here, leading up.

curl into a ball - even for the biggest of adventurers.

The lounge.~
The room gives you an immediate sensation of comfort. Someone must really
enjoy the comfortable life to spend so much money on the lounge. There is a
coffee table to the one side.

table coffee~
The coffee table seems to be a handy place for tea, cake and the tv guide. It
is probably terribly cluttered underneath, so you don't bother to look.

The incinerator.~
This room is used to burn the bodies of those who die in the torture chamber.
There is a thick layer of ash on the ground and the walls are all blackened.

The entrance hall.~
You can't help but feel creepy when you see the entrance hall: it is cold,
creepy and miserable. The candles mounted on the walls do little to light
the room and they flutter in the draught that is blowing through the room.
The front door is south, looking just as imposing from the inside as from
outside.

E
door~
The door has many bolts, all driven firmly home. The wood is almost black
and looks extremely solid. You wonder how you are going to get out.
~
#29864
The conservatory.~
This is a room of plants. Perhaps once upon a time the plants were well
tended to. It might have been once that there were fewer weeds than plants,
but that is sadly not the case in the present time. A glass dome lets in a
little bit of light - not much, as fungus has nearly fully covered the dome.
You spot one pathetic but beautiful flower.

flower~
The flower is probably the last remnant of the beautiful place this must once
have been. It looks very slightly lonely. Shame. Poor flower. *snicker*

The porch.~
You are standing on a rickety-looking porch. It is raining and it looks as if
it has been raining here for a very long time. The roof is incredibly rotten
and is leaking profusely. You attempt to find a place out of the drips, but
are not successful. There is an imposing door.

door imposing~
The door is solid, big and imposing. It looks somehow smug. You get the
impression that it isn't going to let you open it.

#29866
The basement.~
You are standing in a dark, damp and smelly basement. This not the cleanest
room of the house. You strongly suspect that part of the stink is from sewage.
Gross. There is a trapdoor above you and a winerack to the one side.

There is a large variety of wines on the rack. They are labelled, "Cabernet
Sauvignon Blanc", "Graca" and other such meaningless names. It would probably
be better to avoid the wine at all costs.

trap trapdoor~
The trapdoor is square, wooden and fairly sturdy. Other than that, there is not
too much to say about it.

This is the basement. It is under the house. It is dark. It is unpleasant. It
does not smell too nice. To the one side you can see a pile of gardening
equipment.

The pile of gardening equipment comprises of rusty spade, an old gardening fork,
a wheelbarrow and a few other small implements. They do not look overly used:
being a gardener on this estate is probably a rather cushy job.

The basement.~
You are in the basement. Great. Sunny skies, a cool breeze, babes walking past
on the beach in front of you ... Man! This is the life!

Hang on - I think you need a serious reality check here. A dripping ceiling, a
smelly draft and unidentified blobs squelching in the corners.

You are in the basement. This particular section of the basement has a HUGE

This pile is pretty pointless, really. It is so damp in the basement that the

The basement.~
The basement is not a pleasant place. There is a whole lot of old junk here:
broken furniture, old books and even half a shoe. They lie here, disconsolate
and depressed, waiting for the spring cleaning that will never come.

The laboratory.~
You are standing in a room that completely takes your breath away. There are
glass vials standing everywhere. Strange-coloured liquids race through glass
pipes and small puffs of smoke appear out of nowhere. Small laboratory animals
scurry around in cages. The walls look as if they could do with some paint.
