{300}
Ma'ar was the evillest of mages, from the time of the Mage Wars.  He was
defeated by Urtho, the other Lord-Adept, but it required a final strike,
and Urtho did not survive.  Ma'ar, However, did.  He managed, using an
ethereal pocket, to survive and take over one of the bodies of his
descendents.  No one knows where he is now.

The Lost Citadel was the place where the evil Lord-Adept, Ma'ar worked
his magic.

ma'ar~
Ma'ar, the evil Lord-Adept~
The current incarnation of Ma'ar, the evil Lord-Adept is here.~
Looking at Ma'ar, he changes.  First, you see his true form, as Ma'ar, then
it changes, and you see the man named Darkness in tayledras, Leatha, who fought
against Vanyel at the end of the time of the Herald-Mages.  Then, he becomes
Mornelithe Falconsbane, who fought against k'Sheyna, in the time of Elspeth
the first of the new Herald-Mages.  Many more incarnations of him flicker by,
but these scare you most.  You feel the urge to run, and never look back.  Ma'ar
glances at you, and as if reading your thoughts, says, "you have come too far
to continue, I must kill you."  Then Ma'ar attacks, and you sink into darkness...

stone power~
the Stone of Power~
A small, stone lies here, glowing and humming with power.~
You see nothing special about the Stone of Power. Rumour has it that the stone
can be used my mages to open shimmers and pass through them. You notice two
words written into the Stone: 'magepass' and 'mageopen'.

Entrance to the Lost Citadel.~
Here, the plains begin to turn hilly, and you see a mountain spire in the
distance.  You realize, from a sign hanging here, that you have entered the
fabled, long-forgotten Lost Citadel, the place where Ma'ar, the evil
Lord-Adept, created his magical constructs.  You feel a sense of dread
as you creep in the direction of the spire.

to be natural, but then the cave smoothed out, and you realize that this was
hewn from the spire using powerful magic...something informs you that this

Primary Elements, Fire, Water, Air, and Earth, along the wall.  You can't

you have invaded the sanctum of Ma'ar, the evil Lord-Adept, himself.  You
are either a very vain, or a very foolish person, to think that you could
survive against Ma'ar, himself.  Prepare to die, for Ma'ar is indeed here
as you see, walking in.  He sees you, and seems very angry that you are
here.  All of a sudden, a fireball sparks from his fingers, and heads your
way.  You will not have time to duck...

The Test of the Winds~
You are standing in the last room of the Test of Air, the Test of the Winds.
Congratulations, you made it, I'd say, except that you haven't.  You've still
