This man is wearing extravagant clothing from the great artistic trading centers
of the realms. Although extremely old, they have been relatively well cared for.
He was once considered among the great philosophers of Old Singase but now he is
tolerated, his mind slipping due to his extreme age. While Old Singasis now
consider him a worthless old man, his vast knowledge and wisdom would be well
worth your time. He is one of a very few left in Old Singase who were here in
the heyday of the town.

He is wearing the clothes of a great statesman, only these clothes are well worn
and tattered by the effects of time. He still carries an air of intellectual
superiority, despite the criticisms of the populace at large. As you watch him,
he seems to take no notice of you, focusing his attention to the texts at hand.
His reading speed is overwhelming as he litterally flies through texts, bouncing
back and forth between a great multitude of scrolls at a frenzied pace, cross
referencing everything. At times, he stops to scribble something on another
scroll nearby. This man is obviously one of the few remaining great statesmen
from times gone by. It would behoove you to learn what you can from this man.

telling riddles of philosophy to himself as if practicing before delivering
these riddles to a class of intellectually hungry students. His clothes are
well worn and the Old Singasis hurl insults at him, making it obvious to you
that his teaching days in this part of the realms have long since passed. You

She is quite old and poor, although it is obvious she has taken great care of
herself. A widow of a great many years, she depends on the kindness of others
for her sustenance. Her clothes, neat but worn out, her speech simple yet
complex, her eyes old yet piercing to the heart, she speaks of a great simple
wisdom lost to the citizens within her own community. Their folly could well be

Yangal stands here, bidding you welcome.~
She wears clothes of a wealthy debutante, her dress flowing, her jewelry
glittering, her hair glowing in the sunlight. Her face gleams as she smiles at
you. Her wealth is far beyond that of the rest of the citizenry and you wonder
from whence it came. Could she have been born into this wealth? Has she garnered
this wealth herself? You find it hard to believe such a person could exist in
this city of foolishness. She appears to have a great wisdom that no other of
her age and few others older than she even care to obtain here. Perhaps she
could impart some of her Wisdom on you.

Ngurrinji~
Ngurrinji~
Ngurrinji impatiently awaits your decision.~
His arms are very large and scarred by the many years of work with metals,
making a wide variety of weapon and repairing an even wider variety. Upon
closer examination, you see scars that appear to be from some kind of
explosive. His attire is caked with black dust from his kilns, as is his
face and arms.

Kanjamalak~
Kanjamalak stands here, writing scrolls.~
She appears to be quite old and forgetful as she writes scrolls. She seems to
have no idea as to the reason for the scrolls. There must have been a time when
she was a great spellcaster, but that had to have been in the distant past. Her
clothes are in a state of great disarray and have long since outlived their
usefulness.

Fountain~
an old fountain~
An old fountain sprays water sporadically.~
The fountain is molded in the shape of a person, standing fifteen feet tall.
Its once great beauty has been worn down and discolored over the centuries. You
can see where a few careless repairs have been made to its workings. Birds have
used it for bathing and left deposits behind. From time to time it shoots a
weak stream of water into the air, then returns to its incessant gurgling. It
is a shame to see such a work of art in such a sad condition.

Statue~
a statue of a man~
A statue of a man stands in the middle of the boulevard.~
This statue is quite peculiar. It doesn't seem to represent a warrior of any
kind. The man seems diminutive, weak, and quite elderly. You wonder what these
people revere to have a statue of some worthless man standing here. The statue
looks as if it has been here for centuries and has been less than admirably
cared for. Birds have been permitted to build their nests on it with not even
the least disruption to their building.

Statue~
a statue of a woman~
A statue of a woman stands in the middle of the boulevard.~
You are immediately impressed by the absolute unimpressiveness of the woman
portrayed here. She is of barely average beauty and slightly advanced in years.
She has only the slightest smile which, as you look more closely seems to be
more of a sly smirk. Her hands are folded neatly behind her back in a fashion
as to give an authoritarian air. The statue has long been in need of upkeep.
But the birds seem to like it.

same time, you are watching the buildings to make sure they don't start falling

one of the great trade routes of this town's heyday.  The trees and
hedges are much overgrown and in need of much trimming and pruning. The
homes on this side of town are not much better than the other ones.

The trees and bushes on this avenue get worse as you go further from the
boulevard.  You have to duck and twist to avoid the needle sharp
branches.  The homes here were built for the main traders of the town,
so they would have a resting place while attempting to sell their goods
at the marketplace once arriving at home.

The homes on each side of the road appear to have trees growing through
the house.  The overgrown yards have mounds of trash, paper, empty
rusting cans, and paths carved through the yard by small creatures. It
would be wise to stay on the worn paths to the doors, as adventuring off
the path may be harmful to your health.

You have reached one of the many outer city walls.  The watchtower is
directly above you.  There is a strange house to the west. It
definitely does not follow the given "dress code" of the neighborhood.
It's front lawn is very neat.  The tree branches on that side of the
street are not hanging over the hedges.  You could actually use the
sidewalk!  The house on the east side of the road definitely fits in
with the neighborhood scheme.  The front porch is falling apart, the
windows are shattered and boarded up, and the screen door is halfway
hanging off its frame.

that a single match and a stiff wind would erase the whole town in a

rusting tin cans, and heaps of other garbage.

rotted through, the windows are covered with cardboard, the front door
appears to be hanging by one nail.  The yards have mounds and mounds of
garbage.  You could assume that garbage days here have been canceled.

the city from ruffians.  The front yard of the house to the east is very
unusual.  It is very clean.  There is no garbage in the yard, the trees
and hedges are trimmed, and the flower beds are weed-free.  It might pay

You are walking down a once beautiful boulevard. The paving stones show signs

and broken, their beautiful polish worn down by heavy travel down the centuries.
What an interesting sight you see here! As you stand and watch, you see people
wander into the buildings lining this street carrying different items, walk out
carrying nothing, then come back again with other items of perceived
uselessness. They make several trips back and forth before finally leaving with
their original items, only ever so slightly altered.

You can see how well planned this boulevard was when built as the sun seemingly
travels down the boulevard on its path around the realms each day. The boulevard
was also built wide enough to take into account the seasonal shifts of the sun's
path. The decaying town spreads out before you to the west while to the north,
there seem to be some sort of mind games being played. To the south, people are
attempting to turn gold into lead.

impoverished people walking the same streets as extremely wealthy people. It

house has been well cared for as you see no cracks in the walls or damaged spots
in the flooring. The best way you know how to describe this house to your
acquaintances is that it is exquisite.

over the place. The walls have been left to rot and decay, the floor long since
disintegrated and now is a dirt floor. The squalor in which these people live is

You have entered a garbage strewn dump of a residence. As you look around, there
is no getting around the fact there is a tree growing inside the shack! Looking
up, you can't help but wonder whether the tree cracked the rafters of the roof
or if the tree grew to support the roof since the rafters no longer could.

You have entered a terribly run down shack. Looking at the table, you see
mismatched dishes situated in an attempt at a proper appearance. There is
a cracked plate, chipped saucer, cup with handle broken off, a fork with
bent or broken tines, and oversized spoon sitting at each place setting.
It pains your heart to see someone in such squalor trying their hardest
