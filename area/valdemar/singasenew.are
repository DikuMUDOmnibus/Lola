guard~
a New Singase Guard~
A New Singase Guard stands alert to defend the village against intruders.~
The first thing you notice when you see him is his numerous battle decorations.
Obviously, he acted with great honor and courage in a great multitude of
military skirmishes. As you get past his decorations and look at him, you see
him standing alert and studying you to determine whether you are friend or foe.
He is tall for a gnome and wise beyond his years. His armor is impressively made
using the mose expensive and beautiful metals available while still keeping the
strength of the armor. Attacking him would be quite foolish.

A female visitor walks by, awestruck by the sights and sounds.~
She is moderately dressed, wearing clothes of someone on a journey. She seems
totally enthralled by the elegant extravagance of the village and jabbers with
anybody who will permit her about everything she has seen, only to interrupt
herself as she sees a new wonder.

to be in no hurry to get anywhere.

is well to do or not because every villager is comparably dressed. She seems
quite willing to talk with villagers and visitors alike. You can't help thinking
you would love to live here.

street worker~
a street worker~
A street worker leans on a shovel.~
He is obviously not from this village but called in to build the streets here.
His attitude is much less affable than that of the villagers and his work ethic
leaves much to be desired. He wears filthy clothes you would expect from a hard
working man, but you can't see how he finds the time to get dirty, what with
having to exert so much energy holding that shovel up and all.

Jean-Pierre~
Jean-Pierre awaits the arrival of another student.~
He carries himself in a very nondescript manner and his clothing is impressive
in its understatement. He wears very little which would give the appearance of
the wealth he obviously has, instead, choosing to wear the garb you would
expect of visitors to the village. He has a very average form, slightly heavier
than optimum for his average stature, balding ever so slightly, slumped a bit
from years of improper posture. Could he possibly be someone from which to
learn?

Claude~
Claude~
Claude is awaiting the arrival of a new student.~
You see before you a man who has serious problems choosing items to wear. He has
a huge number of rings, necklaces, and bracelets on, none of which come close to
matching his disheveled clothing. He obviously just grabbed stuff, put it on,
and, deciding it didn't look right, just put something else on without bothering
to remove the first item. He is a pitiful sight.

She wears the same jewels you can find in her shop except that she wears them in
much greater abundance than would anyone other than a jewelry shop owner. She

Centre du Village~
You stand in the center of the village. All around you are wondrous sights to
behold. Gemstone paved streets, houses covered in gold and gems, exotic plants,
tropical birds, art and sculptures that dazzle the mind are around every corner.
The villagers act as if all these are commonplace, and indeed they are, at least
in this village. You feel a strange sense of peace and comfort as you drink in
the atmosphere. This is a good place to reflect upon your achievements.

You stand in an intersection like all the other intersections in this village,

the realms. Gemstones are everywhere and in great numbers. Priceless works of
art cover the outsides of the buildings and sculptures of great value sit on the
edge of the streets. Every once in a while, you notice someone peer around
to see if anyone is watching, drop to their knees, pry at a gemstone in the
pavement, then give up and walk away.

street. Villagers pass by discussing various topics.  You hear a villager
mumble about the tablets but become lost as he sounds very scholarly.  You
see the road shine to the east and the west.

walk about discussing village gossip.  You overhear one of the villagers

the end of the road because of the immaculate light.  To the north you see
an oddly built house that seems to be perfect.  You wonder how a house can
look so perfect.  Scholarly villagers walk by you talking amongst each
other.  All you've seen in this village are scholars, it makes you wonder.

gemstones.  In the break you see a tall tower.  There are not as many villagers
wandering around here and you wonder what may be in that tall tower.  On the
other hand, you wonder if it is wise to enter such a tower.  The peacefulness
of the village seems to make you believe that you should not be afraid, but is
it just an illusion?

topics of the day.  You attempt to spy what they are saying but it is of no

You are travelling on an extravagant road.  It is paved with gemstones that
catch the sunlight in just the right way to allow beautiful reflections.
Off the side of the street you see wild plants growing and hear the chatter
of tropical birds.  Villagers pass by you as they go on with their day.
They seem to be heading no where in particular, yet have an agenda to fulfill.
You wonder what they might be thinking.

you are amazed at all the wonderous sights and sounds you've taken in.
Villagers, on the otherhand, walk about as if things are an everyday
occurance.  To them, they are.  You wonder how much of a paradise it would
be to live like these villagers.

very large tower that seems accessible from here.  You hear the everyday
ramblings of the villagers and you are again lost as you cannot comprehend
what they are talking about.  One of the only words you recognize is tablet.
It seems that the tablets are responsible for a lot of talk around town.

This street, like many other streets in this village is paved with precious
stones and gems.  You examine carefully how the villagers walk accross them.
The older villagers walk on them like it was made of cheap material, yet some
others walk carefully as not to harm the street.  You occasionally notice a
visitor attempt to remove a stone.  Unsuccessful, the visitor keeps walking
down the street.  For some reason you notice the diamonds catch your eye.
You notice a significant gathering to the south, it must be where everyone

Travelling down this street, you are amazed and bewildered by the extravagance
to which the villagers have gone in paving their streets. Emeralds, sapphires,
diamonds, rubies and gemstones of every kind and size have been used as paving
stones. The villagers think nothing of walking across them, but you notice many
a visitor walking as if on eggshells in the vain attempt to avoid stepping on
any valuable stones. Occasionally, a visitor tries unsuccessfully to remove one
of the paving stones then, looking around sheepishly, continues on his way.

villagers moving about and decide otherwise.

You now find yourself near a very large gate to the city.  The gate looks well
guarded.  You feel relieved that this village is friendly.  The street covered
in gemstones lead out of the village to the north.  You notice the emeralds in
the street catch your eyes.  Looking far south you notice a gathering place and
wonder what people might be doing there.  The chirping of the birds and the
smells of the flowers make you want to go deeper into the village rather than
leaving.  You also notice a large tower not real far, in fact it seems that you
can reach it from here.

You stand here feeling a breeze of water mist hit you in the face, it makes
you feel very relaxed and refreshed. The water must be coming from the
fountain to the north. You can hear the chattering of villagers passing by and
off in the distance.  All the villagers look very witty.  You wonder if you
could hold a conversation with one without falling into bewilderment.  To the
south you notice what seems to be a never ending tunnel of light.  You realize
it is all from the reflection of the sun on the gemstones in the street.  You
are amazed at how well the gemstones here catch your eye, especially the
beautiful rubies.

are walking on them like it is mere dirt.  An occasional visitor examines the
gems carefully and tries, unsuccessfully, to remove them.  You hear no alerts

notice in the distant north water spraying up into the air.  It is a beautiful
sight because it is spraying up above the shimmerings of a gemstone paved
street.  Off the side of the road you notice a large tower.  You wonder to
yourself what may be up there and if you should go explore.  You don't notice
any extra precautions made to keep visitors and villagers out of the tower.
To the south you notice a very large gate that has been decorated very
beautifully.

relatives through many generations form the focal point of his house. Each one
is expertly painted and in an elaborate gold frame. The furniture is made of
dark, dramatically sculptured wood, overlaid in strategic places to add to its
aesthetic nature without being overly dramatic. If it weren't for the extreme
extravagance of the village, you would consider this a dramatic absurdity of the
use of wealth and an attempt to throw it in your face, but taking the great
wealth of the city into consideration, it seems actually to be more conservative
than you would expect.

looking quite like Laura Annette, the ceiling, one huge painting depicting a
story of times long ago, the floors bare but polished so highly that you can see

animals, heads, people, plants, and some other stuff that has no meaning laying
on top, in front, behind, and under it, to elaborate lighting fixtures with
glass, emerald, diamond and ruby menagerie hanging from them. Each item would
look absolutely beautiful if it were not for all the other things all around it.
As it is, the total enormity of numbers and the disarray with which the artwork
is placed makes it more of an eyesore.

Maison d'Henri~
As you enter the home of Henri, you notice the massive use of straight lines and
angles in the architecture. Actually, everything in the house as well as the
house itself is designed entirely of straight lines and angles. The floor, in
keeping with this design scheme, has no rug but relies on strips of hardwood
interspaced with seemingly random segments of gold and silver, but as you study
it more intensely, you see an intricate mathematical design in the placement of
each board, segment of gold or silver, and even the direction of grain and hue
of stain in the wood. It obviously took intense planning to lay out the floor.
The furniture is placed with care so as not to disturb the mathematical design,
and so, enhances it.

To the east you see the plains open up before you, showing all its secrets. Far

before their arrival and so be strong enough to withstand withering fire from
the archers who would obviously be firing at them from above, well before they
could defend themselves.

type. As you handle the suit of armor, you are amazed by its lack of weight yet
its nearly impenetrable nature. The craftsmanship is quite amazing as you can
see no seems, joints, welds or anything of that nature connecting the flexible
portions of the suit to the rigid portions. The fact that this suit is entirely
complete from the top of the head to the fingertips to the toes and is still
only in two pieces is mind boggling.

To the west you see Singase Plains lying unprotected by the wary eye of a guard
or soldier who would obviously be able to see any approach from many kilometres
away.

two handed sword~
The sword is very polished and quite sharp. It appears to be much heavier than
the average fighter would use. You cringe as you think about the size of fighter
needed to handle such a weapon! You wouldn't want to meet him in a dark alley!

To the south you see the southwestern tower straining for the clouds in a very
foreboding aggressive-defensive stance, protecting the inhabitants from any
enemy. Beyond the tower, you see more of the plains known as Singase with the
inability to hide anything.

This is a perfect place in your mind to situate archers to rain down death and
destruction on infidels while they are far from near enough to make any kind of
offensive stance against the village. It would be foolish for any but the
strongest foes to attempt an attack. The Southeast and Southwest towers are in
close proximity, providing the ability to rapidly reinforce this tower if the
need should arise.
