{300}
The Singase Plains is a large area of peaceful territory deep within the
Valdemar region marked by two trading posts. The plains are covered with
tall grasses with small clumps of trees on rare occasions. Wild animals
peacefully coexist there, the normally carnivorous hunters forsaking their
desire for meat and eating the vegetation and the prey losing their
instinctive fear of the animals who would be, under normal circumstances,
their most dangerous enemies.

The two trading posts grew up in very different eras with towns built around
them. One of these towns has fallen into decay, the residents having no
concern for its appearance or their own. The few wise people who live there
are treated with extreme disrespect, but their wisdom could well enhance your
own. The other town is much newer, still actively growing. The people of this
town have experienced the great fortunes of high times in the trading business
as it has been built using great expenses. They, too, have unusually wise
people living amongst them, but they treat their wise with much more respect.

There seems to be more to the story about these plains as fables concerning a
rare snake abound but are as of yet unproven.

{120}                                 Old Singase
{300}
The town of Old Singase sprung up from an old trading post in the Valdemar
region when travellers needed a place to rest while travelling through the
region. There was nothing around at the time and the distance to the coasts
was great and burdensome. As the explorers came in from far away places, they
invariably would be willing to trade items of great value just for a safe place
to lay their heads. Old Singase reached its zenith shortly before the
Air-Water wars which completely levelled Chakkor. These wars were so great
that they drug the finest men and women from across the realms, leaving behind
the more foolish, poorest to keep the towns alive. Being so far from the rest 
of civilization, Singase, as it was called then, was hit especially hard. It
became almost a ghost town with its great and wise decimated and the explorers
from other towns and villages either being swallowed up in the wars or having
to stay behind to keep the local governing bodies from collapse. Since almost
nobody was coming in to trade, the wisest remaining among the Singase residents
left for greener pastures. What is left of the once thriving town is a nearly
even split of extremely poor and extremely wealthy, the wealthy getting their
money by inheritance rather than hard work. There are but five wise left among
them, but they are aging and will soon be gone as well with none to step up and
replace them. Nobody wants to replace them as they are looked down upon by the
rest of the town, but explorers invariably go to see them in the off chance
they can learn nuggets of Wisdom.

-1 NEWSINGASE 'NEW SINGASE'~
{120}                                 New Singase
{300}
The village of New Singase, like its predecessor, grew out of an old trading
post in the Valdemar region, but unlike its predecessor, came to be long after
the Air-Water wars. They still value wisdom and cherish their philosophers.
The great wealth this village has acquired is shown quite abundantly in their
choice of pavement stones-gems of all kinds and values. On a bright summer day,
it is nearly impossible to see beyond one's sandalled feet due to the glare and
glitter of the gemstone-paved avenues. To learn such from such as these magi,
one must be very careful as things are not always as they appear.

98 SINGSAF 'SINGASE SAFARI'~
{120}                               Singase Safari
{300}
The wilderness known as Singase Safari (pronounced sing-GOSS-see) contains
three distinct zones with a river traversing two of them and ending in the
third.

1- The Jungle

There are a wide variety of jungle animals here, some very large, some quite
small. It can be a very dangerous place to travel if not careful.

2- The Mountains

These mountains are quite treacherous, with snow capped peaks year round. There
are fewer signs of wildlife here with such treacherous terrain. But the snakes
seem to like it.

3- The Desert

It would be quite easy to get a tan, but be careful not to forget it is a
desert! Poisonous snakes live here.

There is a great explorer in the safari who is searching for a fabled snake. It
is said that this snake has the characteristics of many different species of
snake and is found only in this area. Tales have been spread about a great
reward for finding such a snake and returning it to the explorer.

But beware, tales have spread even more rapidly about the harsh punishment of
any who dared to fool him.

Travelling to the safari is quite hazardous and should not be attempted by the
weak of mind or body.

discussion~
The town of Old Singase sprung up from an old trading post in the
Valdemar region when travellers needed a place to rest while travelling
through the region. There was nothing around at the time and the distance
to the coasts was great and bUrdensome. As the explorers came in from far
away places, they invariably would be willing to trade items of great
value just for a safe place to lay their heads. Old Singase reached its
zenith shortly before the Air-Water wars which almost levelled Chakkor.
These wars were so great that they drug the finest men and women from
across the realms, leaving behind the more foolish, poorest to keep the
towns alive. Being so far from the rest of civilization, Singase, as it
was called then, was hit especially hard. It became almost a ghost town
with its great and wise decimated and the explorers from other towns and
villages either being swallowed Up in the wars or having to stay behind to
keep the local governing bodies from collapse. Since almost nobody was
coming in to trade, the wisest remaining among the Singase residents left
for greener pastures. What is left of the once thriving town is a nearly
even split of extremely poor and extremely wealthy, the wealthy getting
their money by inheritance rather than hard work. There are but five wise
left among them, but they are aging and will soon be gone as well with
none to step Up and replace them. Nobody wants to replace them as they are
looked down upon by the rest of the town, but explorers invariably go to
see them in the off chance they can learn nuggets of Wisdom.

~
E
record~
The town of Old Singase sprung up from an old trading post in the
Valdemar region when travellers needed a place to rest while travelling
through the region. There was nothing around at the time and the distance
to the coasts was great and burdensome. As the explorers came in from far
away places, they invariably would be willing to trade items of great
value just for a safe place to lay their heads. Old Singase reached its
zenith shortly before the Air-Water wars which completely levelled Chakkor.
These wars were so great that they drug the finest men and women from
across the realms, leaving behind the more foolish, poorest to keep the
townS alive. Being so far from the rest of civilization, singase, as it
was called then, was hit especially hard. It became almost a ghost town
with its great and wise decimated and the explorers from other towns and
villages either being swallowed up in the wars or having to stay behind to
keep the local governing bodies from collapse. Since almost nobody was
coming in to trade, the wiSest remaining among the Singase residents left
for greener pastures. What is left of the once thriving town is a nearly
even split of extremely poor and extremely wealthy, the wealthy getting
their money by inheritance rather than hard work. There are but five wise
left among them, but they are aging and will soon be gone as well with
none to step up and replace them. Nobody wants to replace them as they are
looked down upon by the rest of the town, but explorers invariably go to
see them in the off chance they can learn nuggets of Wisdom.

A Heavily Travelled Road~
You are travelling a very heavily travelled road used by all who would go
to the two trading posts on these plains. The ground has become very hard
here from all the pack animals, wagons, merchants and the like who have used
this road before you. You recall stories about the two trading posts and
struggle to remember which one was filled with riches beyond compare.
