Valdemar is west of the City of Sarglam.  Valdemar is the creation of author
Mercedes Lackey.  Our Valdemar is based in the time of 1376 AF, in the reign
of Queen Selenay.

Heralds are unique to Valdemar, the monarchs elite guard.  They are chosen
by mystical horse-like beings called Companions, and are good
self-sacrificing people.

Queen Selenay of Valdemar is here.~
She is a tall handsome woman in Herald's whites, for all rulers of Valdemar
must be a herald, though she wears a long skirt with the thigh length tunic
instead of breeches, and the materials are clearly fine velvet and silk.
Her face is triangular and strong rather than pretty and her hair is bound
in a knot at the nape of her neck.  It is a lovely golden colour.  She has
very penetrating, intelligent blue eyes.

A book of Valdemar's History lies neglected on the ground here.~
{540}                        History of Valdemar
{300}
Baron Valdemar founded Valdemar a long time ago.  His aim was
to make a safe place for those he ruled.  He and his sons were
among the first to become Heralds.  One day when worried about
the future, Baron Valdemar, went to what is known as the Companions
Field and prayed to all the Gods he knew for help.  After some time
a Companion, a horse-like being appeared in the grove.  He found that
he could "mind-talk" the companion and the companion had this unique
bond with him alone.  Later another companion appeared and "selected"
the Baron's son.  The companions were just as intelligent if not more
than the humans and gave wise council.

Over time more companions appeared and selected only good people and
these people became known as Heralds.  Baron Valdemar then made it
a rule that all leaders hence forth would have to be Heralds.

Over time the companions mated and new companions were born and they
selected good people to become Heralds.  Eventually only one companion
would appear magically from the grove like the original companions.
This companion would select that Herald that was to be know as the
Monarchs Own.  The Monarch's closest adviser.

A Book of Uniforms in Valdemar lies here neglected on the floor.~
{130}                       Valdemarian Uniforms
{300}
In Valdemar what a person wears will often denote what position and
rank that that person has.  The following is the most common you will
see.

{170}Herald - White Uniform
{070}Trainee Herald - Grey Uniform

{110}Bard - Scarlet Uniform
{010}Trainee Bard - Red-brown Uniform
{300}
{120}Healer - Green Uniform
{020}Trainee Healer - Pale Green Uniform
{300}
{040}Unaffiliate - Blue Uniform
{300}
Note that Unaffilates are students at the collegium, that have
not been called to a purpose of bard, healer or herald.  Often
they are the children of nobles that are sent to the collegium
to hopefully learn something worthwhile.  Often however they
are just stuck up trouble makers.

known as the death bell tolled on his death.  Since then the death of any
