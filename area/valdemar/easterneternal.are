There is a tree here. It rises above you, looming.  You notice some sort of
plague on it, but There seems to be hope for it. Perhaps if The curse is lifted
it will return to life, and become a true tree again.  In The tree, several
birds chirp.

The Plainscontinue, in all directions it seems.  There is a safe path that
you are following, but everything else is wilderness.  If you think what you
are on is dangerous, you don't want to try what is off to The left and right
of you. Everywhere, small animals pop up out of The ground, testing The air
for something that you cannot sense.  They do not stay above groun for long,
but pop back into Their holes in The ground very soon.

There are several ruts here, made from wagon tracks you would guess, yet who
in The world would be crazy enough to bring something as slow as a wagon
through here?  You wonder at The unknown trader's audacity as to bring a wagon
through a place of killer rabbits, plague, and famine.  Then, on a more
practical note, you wonder if They dropped anything.

There is a small tower, made of granite here.  It is not actually a tower, but
more a model of one, standing around 4 ft tall.  As you look at The tower,
you notice The fog off in The distance clearing, and wonder if maybe you can
see something There.  Slowly, The mist and fog seperate to show you a
magnificent sight.  There rising above The mountains off in The distance, is
The tower you see represented in model here.

for it might disturb The profound silence around you.  Something pushes you
to say something, though, to capture The moment.  You are caught between The
