95 OLCGUIDELINES~
{118}*{178}Guidelines
 
{118}*{078}Don't walk around in other builder's areas without their permission.
{118}*{078}Don't be annoying
{118}*{078}Don't write programs that might harm the test mud's performance or crash it.
{118}*{078}Don't use mpcommands or programs to enhance your immortal powers

{118}*{078}The area's theme must fit in with the general Medieval, Fantasy, Tolkien
 based theme of the mud.
{118}*{078}Do not make references to the real world where possible, a few minor hints
 or jokes in that direction are acceptable.
{118}*{078}Write descriptive descriptions, where the main focus should always be to
 describe the room, object or mobile in question, and not any actions taking
 place in it, or emotions that go through the reader. Try to avoid using
 lines like 'A horrifying orc is here.' since that'd be a human point of view,
 and someone playing an undead character would in theory be unable to be
 scared. We suggest descriptions ranging from 3 to 5 lines of text.  If you
 do not enjoy writing them, it's okay to keep them plain and simple, maybe
 somewhat boring, as long as you use proper english and grammar.
{118}*{078}The area should have at least 1 good quest. If possible multiple quests.
 Also it's suggested to add some fun stuff, to liven things up, but don't
 make the mobs overly spamming.
{118}*{078}The area shouldn't be a leveling machine, this means that the mobs
 shouldn't be lined up waiting to be butchered. You must enter some sort of
 element of surprise, or another obstacle in it. This includes limitting
 the amount of mobiles. In general it's suggested to let your level mobs
 walk around.
 
{118}*{178}In order for your area to make it to the real game, the above mentioned
 qualities will be measured against it.

{118}* {078}When creating an area for Lowlands you agree that Lowlands has
{118}  {078}the right to use and modify the area as we see fit.
{118}  {078}
{118}* {078}You also understand and agree that Lowland is unable to provide
{118}  {078}copies of area files to their creators.

95 GRAMMAR~
{138}
        GRAMMAR RULES FOR THE UNENLIGHTENED; OR, HOW TO WRITE GOODLY
{300}
Don't use no double negatives Don't never use no triple negatives. No sentence
fragments Corollary: Complete sentences: important. Stamp out and eliminate
redundancy. Avoid cliches like the plague. All generalizations are bad.
Corollary: All statements must be specific. Never listen to advice. Take
care that your verb and subject is in agreement. A preposition is a bad
thing to end a sentence with. Down with categorical imperatives. Avoid those
run-on sentences that just go on, and on, and on, they never stop, they just
keep rambling, and you really wish the person would just shut up, but no,
they just keep going, they're worse than the Energizer Bunny, they babble
incessantly, and these sentences, they just never stop, they go on
forever...if you get my drift... Never contradict yourself always. You
should never use the second person. When dangling, watch your participles.
Never go off on tangents, which are lines that intersect a curve at only one
point and were discovered by Euclid, who lived in the sixth century, which
was an era dominated by the Goths, who lived in what we now know as
Poland... As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, 'I hate quotations.' Excessive
use of exclamation points can be disastrous!!!!! Remember to end each
sentence with a period Don't use commas, which aren't necessary. Don't use
question marks inappropriately? Don't be terse. Don't obfuscate your theses
with extraneous verbiage. Never use that totally cool, radically groovy
out-of-date slang. Avoid tumbling off the cliff of triteness into the black
abyss of overused metaphors. Keep your ear to the grindstone, your nose to
the ground, take the bull by the horns of a dilemma, and stop mixing your
metaphors. Avoid those abysmally horrible, outrageously repellent
exaggerations. Avoid any awful anachronistic aggravating antediluvian
alliterations.

>act_prog [p] <argument>
{300}
The argument is a list of keywords separated by spaces. If the first word is
the character 'p' by itself then the rest of the word list is considered to
be a phrase.  If the first word is the character 'k' by itself then the rest of
the word list is considered to be a set of keywords which all must be matched.
The trigger is activated whenever a keyword (or the phrase) is contained in the
act() message. Both the phrase and keywords are not case sensitive.

The act_prog will trigger on every action made by a player, it ignores mobs

{138}
  Give Programs
{168}

mobile's inventory.  A single coin has vnum 2, an amount of coins has vnum
3. They can be refered to as : I2 and I3.  Dropping the coins and picking

 delay expires.

or           checks for a condition  example: or level ($n) <= 50
and          checks for a condition  example: and level ($n) < 95

!            logical not:  example: if !delayed ($n)

else         is called when the result of the if check are false
elseif       is called when the result of the if check is false.
endif        ends an if check

break        bails out of the entire mobile program

switch       checks for a condition  example : switch level ($n)
case         checks for a specific value of the switch
default      checks if no case value has been found
endswitch    ends a switch

mpquiet on   all commands are executed unseen

95 QUESTBITS~
{138}
  Quest Bits for Dummies
{300}
Every Player has 128 bits allocated for every area, at default those bits
are all set to zero.

The mprog code will allow you to select up to 32 bits at a time from the
total of 128. It is highly suggested (so just do it) that you always select
groups of 4 bits. This being 4, 8, 12, etc bits.

To select a group of bits:

-first select the first bit of the group of bits you want to use, this is
 a number between 0 and 124. The number must dividable by 4, thus
 being 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, etc.
-second select the amount of bits, this is a number between 4 and 32,
 being 4, 8, 12, 16, etc.

Depending on the amount of bits you select you can assign a certain value to
those bits. Here is an overview for the most commonly used amounts of bits:

 4 bits allows you to set a value between 0 and   15
 8 bits allows you to set a value between 0 and  255
12 bits allows you to set a value between 0 and 4095

example:

if quest (0,4,$n) == 6  Checks if bits 0, 1, 2, 3, equal 6
if quest (4,4,$n) == 0  Checks if bits 4, 5, 6, 7, equal 0

Setting a quest bit goes very much the same way.

Example

mpmset $n quest 0 4 9  Sets bits 0, 1, 2, 3, to equal 9
mpmset $n quest 8 8 69 Sets bits 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, to equal 69

Notes:

-mpmadd $n quest 0 4 1  will increase the value of the quest bits, once the
 value becomes 15, and you try to increase the value, the value will become
 0. You can use that behavior to your advantage.

-Quest bits can be set on players, mobs and objects.
