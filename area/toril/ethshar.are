ethshar history book~

The History of Ethshar.
As long as can be remembered, Ethshar was at war with the Northern Empire.
The one day,  the demonologists of the north summoned the demons of hell
to help them in the war against their enemy, ethsher, for they were
losing.  The unleashed demons ravaged the eastern part of ethshar leaving
nothing but a blasted desert, but then the Gods in heaven intervened
and chased the demons back to hell and the northerners with them, and
the Great War was over.  The Three remaining leader of Ethshar's army
decided to form their own empire for, in the time that the Great War went
on, Old Ethshar had fragmented and become hundreds of squabbling little
kingdoms each claiming to be the REAL Ethshar.  Thus, The Hegemony of
Ethshar was created.  Generals Gor and Anaran both started building cities
around the fortress' they protected, Gor calling his Ethshar on the Rocks,
and Anaran calling his Ethshar of the Sands.  Admiral Azrad, who alread
based in a great city simply stayed where he was.  In time the  Azrad's
Ethshar came to be known as Ethshar of the Spices.

Gulf of the East~
This great body of water is inhabited by pirates from the Pirate Towns.
The deep blue sea is fairly peaceful on most days, but you would not
want to be in the vicinity when a pirate ship arrives.  Most ships
that travel the gulf do so heavily armed or carrying a magician of
some sort.
