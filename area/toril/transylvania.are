Do vampires exist?  Or are they just a fable created by adults to frighten
children?  Who knows, but I like vampires so I made one with ninjas and
vampire hunters.  You will need a ninja and lots of firepower to finish the
quest here.  But the stuff you get is worth it. Oh, a bit of advice.  You
should always enter from the entrance...

{138}Enjoy!

This large green bipedal monster is about nine feet tall.  It is completely
covered with green plant growth, or perhaps is made out of it.  Its huge arms
seem quite powerful, and you hope you don't have to feel their wrath.  This
swamp creature or swamp thing is something to be feared.

End of the cemetary~
You stand at the end of the town cemetery.  To the west is a large crypt,
with no visible way in.  The crypt is sealed very tightly, as if to keep some
unholy creature inside.

You are in an older part of the cemetery, where the weeds have overgrown a
bit.  You can see from the headstones that some of these graves are over 500
years old.  This town must have a long history you think to yourself.  The
path south leads back to the main walkway.

from its striking resemblance to a skull.  Glancing up, you can see the eyes
of the skull watching you.  A strange glowing light shines at the top of the
mountain, illuminating the swirling clouds.  A path also runs west around
the giant peak.

The northern entrance~
You stand at the northern entrance to the village.  The sturdy gate to the
south must have been designed to keep out something.  The path here goes
north, then turns towards the east towards a bridge.

A path outside the town~
The road here is surprisingly worn.  You would think travel in this direction
would be limited, yet you see many wagon tracks and footprints.

A well trodden path~
You walk along an amazingly clean road.  Only wagon tracks and footprints
litter the ground here.  You can see a four way intersection to the north,
while the path back to the city is west.  What looks to be a farmhouse is
to the east.

An intersection~
You stand at an intersection along the road.  To the east you can see what
look to be tents.  To the west is the town cemetery.  The path north leads
to an old stone bridge.  You can always go back south towards the
town as well.

A stone bridge~
You stand at a well built bridge of stone.  A slowly moving river flows below
you.  The current seems to travel east.  To the north you can see a dark
foreboding mist covered forest.

Along a dark river~
You wade waist deep into a dark muddy river.  A thin mist begins to form
around you, cutting short your visibility.  You can still see the bridge to
the west, perhaps now would be a good time to go back.  The river continues
on to the east before turning south.

Along a dark river~
The mist over the dark water is thicker this far down the river.  Tall trees
form a wall which channels the river to the south.  You think you feel
something brush against your leg, or maybe it's just your imagination.

if something has entered the water with you.

A black lagoon~
You have come to the end of the river, and are now in a large lagoon.  The
water here is deep black, and quite murky.  A wall of trees forms a barrier,
which bars any exits except back to the west.  Oddly enough, the lagoon is
very silent.  Too silent in fact.

Wading in a river~
As soon as you jump into the river, a very thick mist swirls and forms around
you, cutting off any visibility.  Luckily you can still feel the bridge to
the west.  The river continues to the west, but with zero visibility, going
there is not recommended.

upon a catwalk which leads to an iron gate.  Looking down below, all you see
are the burning flames of hell.
