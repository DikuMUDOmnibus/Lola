your west is the Sea of Swords.  The sea of swords is dotted here and there
with sails of cargo ships.  You are on a steep coast line atop of which is a
steep wall, dotted at regular intervals with sturdy towers.  It is broken
only in the centre of the escarpment , where the cliff is so tall and steep
that no man can possibly scale it.

you can see a hundred stalwart towers proudly holding their turrets just high
enough to be visible to you outside the city.  You can see why Waterdeep is
also know as the City of Splendours.  Beyond Waterdeep you can see a small
mountain rising some 700 feet above the plains watching over the city that
bears its name.  At the top of Mount Waterdeep you can see a lone tower,
around which flocks birds of enormous size.  As you walk closer you see that
they are not birds at all but griffons.  And on the back of each is a man.

Well Shaft~
The name of the inn above you - "Yawning Portal" refers to more than the tall

indoor well, which leads to the caverns beneath Mount Waterdeep.
