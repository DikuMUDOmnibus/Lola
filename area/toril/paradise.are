{171}                      The History of Paradise Island                            {088}

Long ago in the Kingdom of Amazonia, men and women were treated as equals.
Men and women had equal say, equal duties, and equal respect.  All this
changed when the just King Nedhis passed away, and Prince Cram ascended the
throne.  Unlike King Nedihs, King Cram believed that a woman was only good
for sex and giving birth.  He took away their rights, for he stated that
Women were the weaker sex, and could not survive without men to protect them.
Finally, after years of domination, wise Queen Charity got tired of the
Tyrant Cram.  On the third Summer Festival of Crams coronation, she organized
all the women of Amazonia, and led them from the Kingdom.  They sailed away
into the ocean, and founded an all female society on a small tropical island.
They voted that leaders would be chosen not by their bloodline, but by their
ability.  A great competition was held, testing each woman in combat, agility,
and spirituality, and the best in these three challenges were honored as
leaders.  A challenge of leadership could be made at any time, but these
tests were difficult, and rarely passed.

The primary quest will get you either high level mana, ac, or damage eq.
You can also forge a nice weapon if you finish the quest and find the required
items.  Unfortunately there's no way to restrict items to a particular sex,
so guys can use the amazon tops and skirts and other various things you may
find there, if you're into that sort of thing.

{171}=============================== PARADISE QUESTS ==============================={088}
{078}
There are three quests that you can do if you are a female char.  Of course
I've added a quest that male chars can do as well.  You sorta get captured if
you're a male and have to prove your studness.  Note however that you will be
branded with a tattoo that can only be removed if you finish the quest, or by
paying a large sum of money to the jailer.

For the female quests, you may chose to challenge for mana, ac, or dam eq.
The stuff is pretty good, so the quest is challenging as well.

The quests here are all solo quests, but the fights are not too hard.  I've
provided escape routes for the quest battles just in case.

  {128}(-) {058}Return
~

0 PARADISE_TIPS~
{171}================================== T I P S ===================================={088}

Solving the quest requires attention to detail.  I've hidden secret messages
within the descriptions, and if you need more clues, you can always look
harder in some rooms.  Also take notes regarding what the amazons say, heck
take notes on everything.  You never know when you will be asked questions.
There are some things one needs to use logic to figure stuff out, but the
descriptions hold the key to solving these puzzles.

This area is the home of the legendary Amazons, a society made up entirely
of females.  Thus, only female chars are allowed on the island.  Male chars
who infringe upon the isle will be captured and punished accordingly.

After a few generations, a young upstart challenged all three leaders
and succeeded in passing all the tests.  She was granted a boon by
the gods, the magical 'Wonder Eq'.  She became the champion of Paradise
Island and was honored and respected by everyone.  After many years of
heroic deeds, Diana was elevated to the Status of Goddess.  She split
her magical eq amongst the three new leaders, declaring that whoever can
pass the tests shall earn the right to that eq.  To this day, she sits
atop her palace in the sky, eating her chocolate covered raisins,
observing the Amazon population.

chapter_one~
{171}The History of Paradise Island{308}
Long ago in the Kingdom of Amazonia, men and women were treated as
equals.  Men and women had equal say, equal duties, and equal respect.
All this changed when the just King Evad passed away, and Prince Cram
ascended the throne.  Unlike King Evad, King Cram believed that a woman
was only good for sex and giving birth.  He took away their rights, for
he stated that Women were the weaker sex, and could not survive without
men to protect them.
Finally, after years of domination, wise Queen Charity got tired of
the Tyrant Cram.  On the third Summer Festival of Crams coronation, she
organized all the women of Amazonia, and led them from the Kingdom.
They sailed away into the ocean, and founded an all female society on
a small tropical island.  They voted that leaders would be chosen not
by their bloodline, but by their ability.
A great competition was held, testing each woman in combat, agility,
and spirituality, and the best in these three challenges were honored
as leaders.  A challenge of leadership could be made at any time, but
these tests were difficult, and rarely passed.

After many days of constant sailing, you finally arrive upon the shore of
a large jungle island.  You jump into the warm sand of the beach and kiss
the ground beneath your feet.  It is very hot here as bright beams of
sunlight shine down from the clear skies.  You can probably fry an egg on
the sun baked rocks.

here.  A small amount of light filters in from above through a crystal
sunroof, making the flower petal covered water glint and sparkle.  Three
stone irises block off rooms to the west, north, and east.
 A stairway leads up into another chamber.

The E.S. Minerva~
This is small, well-built galleon.  She seems very sturdy and resistant
to damage.  She is painted entirely in white, with a solid oak steering
wheel. The words 'E.S. Minerva' are painted along the side of the mighty
hull. This ship can never sink you think to yourself as you admire her
workmanship.

The smithy~
This room holds a single large smelting pit, with a glowing anvil sitting
right smack in the middle.  It's kinda hot in here, as the glowing embers
generate tremendous amounts of heat.
