Landover is a small Kingdom.  No one knows its precise location. It is rumored,
however, that Meeks, former Court Wizard of Landover's royal house, is able to
provide magical transport for adventurers to this mysterious kingdom. Meeks
resides above Rosen's Store in Roterodamum.

The Heart~
This is the fabled Heart of Landover, where all Kings of this small fiefdom are
crowned.  Surprisingly, it is merely a small meadow, buried deep in the woods.
In its center rises a platform made of darkly burnished oak, the royal coat of
arms carved into its apron.

The sand here is dark, the color of tanned hide, and it rises and falls in

A broad, misshapen ravine sprawls here, filled with innumerable craters, their
bowls filled with a bluish liquid on which yellow-red flames dance and burn,
casting shadows upon the walls.  A purple mist surrounds the edges of the
ravine, which seems to breath with a life of its own.

This is a small, cramped office, dominated by an enormous teak desk.  The desk
is piled with neatly stacked papers, some of which are yellowed with age.
