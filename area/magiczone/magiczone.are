{138}                               The Magic Zone
{308}
The Magic Zone was created from a meld of the works of Robert Jordan
(the Wheel of Time series), David Eddings (the Belgariad, the Mallorean,
the Elenium, and the Tamuli), L.E. Modesitt, Jr (the books of Recluce), and
some of my own twisted adventures in three years of playing Rifts(tm) the
role-playing game.

-1 MAGICZONE1~
{308}
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the people who made the
creation of this area possible, twisted as some of the ideas may be...

  Robert Jordan, for writing the totally awesome Wheel of Time series

  David Eddings, for writing the excellent books informally known as
  'the Sparhawk books', and 'the Belgarion books' :)

  L.E. Modesitt, Jr., for writing the books of Recluce...which gave me
  new and valuble insights into the realms of order and chaos.

  Nuts, Belgarath, Polgara, for his real-life fetishes which inspired
  me to create certain mobs and objects.

  Tamara, Bolts, Indiglo, for even more real-life fetishes which
  inspired me to create more of the aforementioned mobs and objects.

  Kenaras (not giving his RL name to protect him *grin*), for all his
  valuable assistance with various fixes to try to get the area past
  the area checker without having it bitch at me.

  John, for his fascination with weaponry...and his reminder that
  Glocks rule.

  Chaste and Presto, for being patient with my questions about area
  coding.

  and me, of course, for having the sheer genius to combine all the many
  ideas contained into the area you are reading this file for.
  (hey, I'm usually not arrogant, so I feel I'm entitled to this
  little bit of arrogance) :) Besides...I've spent enough time
  writing this area.

I tried to make most of the eq in the Zone both fair, and decent. Due to the
fact that I think object programs are _*really* f***ing cool_, I made some of
the items do some cool things. I'm particularly pleased with the Helm of the
Wolf. Do check it out.

~
>speech_prog yes seek knowledge~
mpecho $I looks pleased.
say Well, what would you like to know about?
say History, perhaps? Or maybe about Lord Hunter?
~
>speech_prog history lord hunter~
say Well, the Lord Hunter has a great deal to do
say with many things. It was he who created the Zone
say and taught many of magics prevalent in the Zone.
say Some say he is immortal, and knows all.
say While he never confirms his exact age, it is known
say that he is at least 2000 years old, as he is in many
say works of art and many books, some of which date back that far.
say It is rumored that he is the master of magics beyond
say anything the world knows, and that he can even master
say time itself, as he never seems to age.
say He built the defenses of the Zone, as well as the Tower of Time.
say I suspect that he may have even helped create some of the
say creatures of this realm, although no one knows how.
~
>speech_prog tower time~
say The Tower of Time is truly a strange place. No one knows
say truly knows everything about it, as some floors and rooms
say deny access to all except for the Lord Hunter and the Traveller.
say What is known, however, is that many of the Zone's defenses
say arise from that place, that the Traveller first came from
say the Tower during the Invasion, and that there are supposed
say to be rooms which have Portals to other worlds...
say other dimensions, although none but the Lords have ever
say entered those rooms. There are rooms which lead to various
say points in the Zone, however, and there may even be
say connections to other points in this world.
~
>speech_prog dimensions~
say Well, in a sense, this is not the same dimension as
say the rest of the world... the entrance to the Zone is
say a dimensional rip: A tear in the fabric of space, which
say helps prevent certain evils from infesting this realm.
say It is said that some worlds host great evils, which would
say prey upon us, enslave us, but for this 'shift'.
say Unfortunately, more mundane evils may enter.
~
>speech_prog traveller~
say The Traveller is said to be at least as powerful as
say the Lord Hunter, and that he is even more dangerous
say than Lord Hunter, as well as being even more knowledgeable
say in magic, although he is not here as often.
mpecho $I looks around nervously.
say It is fortunate that the Traveller is benevolent to us...
say Lord Hunter is said to have once said that the two of
say them have literally destroyed worlds... although this
say has never been confirmed.  What is known is that
say the Traveller helped develop the weapons and armor
say made here, especially cuendillar...
~
>speech_prog invasion~
say About 1500 years ago, mages from another world attempted
say to overthrow the Lord Hunter and enslave us all...
say and the mages nearly won, except that Lord Hunter called
say upon the Traveller, who helped save our home.
say In return, we aid the Lords in their pursuit of knowledge.
~
>speech_prog defenses~
say Well, the defenses are mainly mundane in nature,
say such as the mage-warriors who patrol the city, and
say the Guardians who defend the realm.
~
>speech_prog knowledge~
say The Lord Hunter is always searching for new knowledge,
say and is said to reward those who help him.
~
>speech_prog cuendillar~
say Cuendillar, also known as heart stone, is made with
say the One Power, and once forged, is indestructable.
say Neither magic nor brute force can damage it...unfortunately,
say it also tends to be somewhat heavy. It is said that
say some cuendillar may have been made into armor...Lord
say Hunter would probably know more than I, although the
say Traveller would certainly know,  as he is the one who
say helped create the stuff...as well as the heron-mark
say blades.
~
>speech_prog heron-mark blades~
say Well, to put it simply, the heron-mark blade is the
say weapon of a blademaster. They are made of the highest
say quality metals. Some were even forged with the One Power,
say and those blades are indestructible. The edge
say never dulls, and the blade will never corrode or break.

A priest of Death walks here, alone and without cause.~
The Priest of Death is dressed in pure gray. He also appears to be somewhat
of a mage. He looks particularly sad, possibly due to the absence of his
deity. Yet he seems oddly hopeful.

This man has the most peculiar clothing on. He's wearing things that glow
with strange light and have assorted runes and arcane symbols on them. The
more you look at him, the more certain you are that he is not of this

that looks like a crossbow without the bow.

End of a woodland path~
This is the end of the neat woodland path. There is a strangely beautiful
tower ahead of you. A strangely glowing barrier prohibits you from continuing
any farther to the east..or the north...or south, for that matter. The only
way back is to the west.

There's hardly any light-colored plants here, for that matter. This place
doesn't seem sickly, however...in fact, you don't know if you have ever seen
such healthy plants. The only wierd thing is, they almost seem to form a
symbol.

This is an extraordinarily beautiful lake. The water is crystal clear for the

Entrance to the Temple of Order~
This room has a simple elegance to it. The walls, floor, and ceiling are
made from stone so black, it almost seems to suck light into it. The only
other color that you see is silver, which is what the giant emblem of Order
that is engraved in the floor seems to be made of.

Entrance to the Temple of Chaos~
This room is decorated with extremely complex patterns of gold-etched runes.
The walls, ceiling, and floor are made from stone which is a brilliant white.
At the same time, however, you think that you see chaotic fractal patterns
made from light of every hue...it is almost like looking at an oil slick...
very disorienting. There is a giant emblem of Chaos engraved in the floor.

The Void~
All about you is void, and nothingness.  You look off into Eternity, and
see nothing.  For that matter, you hear nothing, and the only feeling that
you have is that you are falling.  As you flail around, you find that you
are unable to tell which way is up, as there is *NOTHING* here that you
can use for reference.
