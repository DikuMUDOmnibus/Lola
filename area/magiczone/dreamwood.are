                                  Dreamwood
{308}
An area of magic and dreams, the Dreamwood is an extraordinarily peaceful part
of the woods near the City of Eternity where the dreamlike atmosphere is said to
assist in meditation and other deep thoughts. It is thus ever-popular with the
philosophers and poets of the Realms, and even some famous travelling mages have
been known to stop there to exchange gossip and trade items acquired on their
travels. The richness of the animal life in the area is also legendary. Finally,
rumour has it that the entrance to the Realm of Dream is to be found in this
area.

{308}
1. I have tried to make the area as complete as possible. What this means in
mudding terms is that I have tried to make it possible to 'examine' every object
mentioned in a room description. Some of the clues you will need are provided
by these objects, so be sure to examine everything!

2. I realise the quests in this area are pretty short and simple. This is my
first area so give me a break :P The next one will be much more complex, I
promise!

3. The area is designed to be an interesting alternative to leveling in the
Tethyr tavern. There are additional complications though, in the form of some
wandering mobs who might interfere in your fights. The denizens of the Realm of
Dream may also change your tanking style ...

Common Dreamer~
a common dreamer~
A common dreamer is stuck in a nightmare here.~
This translucent figure is the spirit of an ordinary person who through a
particularly intense nightmare has found their way into the Dreamworld. The
expression on his face suggests something terrifying and you can tell from his
posture that he is rooted to the spot. Despite his immobility he seems able to
slightly manipulate the fabric of this realm in order to simulate a little
magic.

an apprentice dreamwalker~
An Apprentice Dreamwalker is learning to dreamwalk here.~
This individual is easier to make out that the common dreamers since his body
seems slightly more substantial. He wears a look of trepidation on his face but
seems determined to master his emotions. He is able to move about the
Dreamworld, albeit slowly. Being able to move suggests he has made some progress
in manipulating the fabric of this realm and can effect a few spells.

A Dreamwalker Adept is moving purposefully here.~
Here stands someone who has achieved proficiency in the art of Dreamwalking. His
form is virtually solid with only a slight shimmer visible when he moves around.
He looks like he knows what he is doing as he moves purposefully across the
plain. Being able to move moderately swiftly suggests he has made noticeable
progress in manipulating the fabric of this realm.

A Senior Dreamwalker surveys his surroundings here.~
You can see from observing this individual's very solid physical manifestation
that this is one of the rare few who achieve sufficient proficiency in the art
of Dreamwalking to totally transport their real bodies to the realm of dreams.
Unlike the lower orders he seems fully aware of your presence. You can see that
he has also learnt to somewhat manipulate the fabric of this realm to simulate
spell-casting.

A Dreammaster is directing dreams here.~
The band of silver around the hems of this figures' robes indicate mastery of
the dreamworld. Not only is his body fully substantial but, as you can see from
the glow of magic around him, he has also learnt to somewhat manipulate the
fabric of this realm according to his own desires. His movement is also
noticeably swifter than that of the others.

A Grand Dreammaster conducts important business here.~
From the looks of the gold-trimmed robes this character is wearing, he must be
one of the very few known Dreammasters. As you would expect he appears to have
fully materialised in this realm and has total control over his environment. The
glow of spells around his body and the fact that he is actually flying signify a
great mastery of the Dreamworld. The thought of what he could do if he was ever
faced with combat in this realm beggars the imagination.

You are looking at the stuff of nightmares! The creature seems to be an
amalgamation of all the worst things you can imagine. It has tentacles, claws,
horns and only one huge blood-red eye which glares at you balefully. Long
tendrils of saliva dribble out of the creatures foul-smelling mouth.

As you enter this moss-covered grotto you are almost overwhelmed by a feeling of
tranquility. There is a small shrine here containing a battered wooden statue of
Chaos. A natural spring bubbles out of the rocks beneath the shrine and
trickles away in a small stream. This looks like an ideal location to camp for

Your headlong rush into the unknown has resulted in you materialising on an
apparently featureless plain. As far as the eye can see nothing is visible
except for two huge portals and a large chessboard built into a hefty granite
stand. The portals are equidistant from the chessboard and are apparently
constructed from smoke.

Beyond Yin~
After the soul-draining power of the Pinnacle of Yin this room feels strangely
revitalising. Upon further reflection you discern that the power of Yin is no
longer so overwhelming. You seem to be approaching an area of equilibrium
between the opposing forces. On the southern wall of this room is a huge
circular slab of stone bearing a mosaic of the swirling Yin and Yang symbol of
Morpheus. However only the white half of the symbol is inlaid. The circular
walls of this room appear to be made of the smoothest alabaster and show an
incredibly beautiful painting of a stark white-sand desert.

You have reached the Center, the one place where Yin and Yang are perfectly
balanced. You find yourself in the middle of a beautiful pastoral scene of
rolling hills with a small stream winding its way past you. There are trees
dotted around and the sound of birdsong fills the air. Through your hat you can
feel the warmth of the noon sun high in the sky above you. Atop a nearby hill
you see a small thatched cottage. According to legend this is the dwelling place
of Morpheus, the Lord of Dream.

This has been my first ever area. I have tried to make an interesting leveling
area with a couple of decent and not-too-complicated quests. Since one of my pet
peeves has always been very basic room descriptions I have tried to include
lots of things to look at and examine, based on the text in room descriptons.
Many of the clues for this quest were in there, so hopefully you enjoyed reading
them all (including the red herrings hehe). Although I have consciously kept it
relatively straightforward and not totally obscure like some other quests I
could name.
 
I hope you enjoyed everything, and hopefully the leveling here will be decent
enough to make you come back in the future.

revert to the original shape after various permutations. The constant barrage
