Ozukawa is a small village north of Kytar. It is riddled with disputes between
the Shinai (followers of Chaos) and the Takoia (disciples of Lord Chaos). There
is a legend that speaks of a third group, the Donzai, who exist to keep the two
groups under control. The Ozukawans are said to be skilled with the use of
bamboo and other natural building materials, such as grass and straw. Fishing is
a very important part of their culture, being a main source of food.

The rumoured Donzai could possibly hold a secret, perhaps visiting their leader
would lead to interesting results. Also, a person in the village is in need of
help. He has lost something. Make sure to pay attention to what is said to you,
and follow instructions carefully.

Being my first area, I am sure there are some things I would like to have done
better, but I am pleased with how it turned out for my first. Mucho thanks to
Demise, Gaia and all others who helped me (which includes pretty much anyone who
ran into me while I was building!)
