    {038}This area  is called  the Realm of the Forgotten.  It is  my first area
    {038}and I have  decided to  make it  a pure  quest area something  like the
    {038}Tower of Reason by Order.  Everyone can only attempt the quest twice in
    {038}a life time. If you fail, you will have to reincarnate to try the quest
    {038}again. Finally, I believe I have a very nice story behind this area and
    {038}the rest of the story will be told in my later areas,  however I am not
    {038}much of a writer,  so in many parts of the quest I might have failed to
    {038}show what I really wanted to say.  Anyway I have edited these text many
    {038}times  and well I hope that  when I write my next area, the story would
    {038}be told in a more interesting way. *bow*

    {118}This area has been updated by Rukawa on March 20th 1997

                                  The Story

       {038} 90 years ago, there were two very powerful kingdoms:  Dhel'har and
{038}Melstrom.  Dhel'har  was ruled by  King Algron,  a knight so powerful that
{038}knows no equal at that time.  Legend says that King Algron draws his power
{038}from an ancient God,  the God of Light and  Goodness;  Lord Kyn.  Melstrom
{038}was  ruled  by a very  powerful  sorceress,  Queen Ecilia,  a sorceress so
{038}powerful that her powers was said to be only equaled by that of Lord Order
{038}and  Lord  Chaos.  Algron  met  Ecilia  for the  first time in a beautiful
{038}Summer's day. Algron was captured by Ecilia's beauty when he laid his eyes
{038}on her.  Algron  and Ecilia later fell in love and decided to get married.
{038}The night  before Algron's  marriage, he left the castle with Sir Zanl'ir,
{038}his best friend as well as his first knight, to have a walk.  That was the
{038}last time Dhel'har ever saw their King again.  Sir Zanl'ir was later found
{038}badly wounded and his arm was bitten off. Saint Iycile, the Arch-Priest of
{038}Dhel'har did his best to revive Sir Zanl'ir, but Sir Zanl'ir was too badly
{038}wounded. Three months later,  Saint Iycile  lead a group of knights out of
{038}Dhel'har and disappeared. Sir Theanos and Sir Karouser too left Dhel'har a
{038}few days  later and  was never  to be seen again.  The once great Dhel'har
{038}quickly  collapsed after  losing it's  leader.....  Rumors said  that King
{038}Algron is dead,  some said that  his followers  killed him,  and some said
{038}that he  went into hiding.  Until today,  what happened to King Algron and
{038}Dhel'har remains a mystery....

                              Tips to the quest

        {038}Role-playing is the key to solving this little quest. This is a
{038}quest to become a Paladin of an Ancient God: Lord Kyn, the God of Light
{038}and Godness. Thus to become a holy knight,  one must think and act like
{038}one.                                                                   
        {038}NPCs which you will encounter in the area will talk to you, and
{038}they will tell you important information. Due to some of the length  of
{038}these speeches, it is wise to turn off all your channels to avoid spam.
{038}Copy and paste those speeches into a text file will help.              

        {038}Each PC will be allow two  chances to try the quest.  Use those
{038}chances wisely for that is just enough for you to pass the quest if you
{038}are very careful.                                                      

        {038}To avoid spam, I have added some code to delay the mob's speech
{038}Thus do not leave the room if the mob pauses for about a minute. 1 minute
{038}is the maximum time the speeches should pause under normal lag. Best is
{038}to use common sense to judge when does the speeches end.               

{138}                       Finally, good luck to you all.

Road of the Saint~
You keep on swimming towards the grassy field, and the grassy field is
always about three feet away from where you are. You look back and all you
can see is water. You dare not slow down because you fear that if you slow
down, dry land will be further and further away from you.

Finally, you made it to the grassy field. As you are about to relax 
yourself to recover from that long swim, you feel that the ground under 
your feet is heating up. When you look down, you see that steam is coming 
out from the earth, and the whole place starts to burn.

Even before the lava gets to you, the hot steam has been killing you.
All you can do now is to run, to stay on the move hopping that you 
would find some high land or a tunnel to hide.

You have no idea how long have you been running, you ran and ran, until 
you can no longer feel your legs. You fall down and fainted. When you 
regain consciousness, you find yourself lying in the middle of a HUGE 
desert. Again, the mountain path, the stream, and the lava seems to be so 
unreal, until you saw the wounds on your legs.

You started walking amilessly in this strange desert. The sand here is 
very fine and there is no sign of life, not even cactus. You keep on 
walking and walking. As you are walking, you ask yourself, "Why the 
hell did I get out of the stream so fast!" continuously.

As soon as you set foot into this oasis, the palm trees transform into

boiling, red hot lava!!

You fall on the sand and realized that you are still in the desert. You 
look back and there is no Oasis, and there is no Lava. You tell yourself, 
it must have been a mirage.

You suddenly see the end of the desert. It is like "THE CREATOR" also 
known as "GOD" has take a knife and cut a piece of this world away. 
Beyond the "end" of the desert, you see strange lines and colors, as if 
that is how nature looks like when it's skin is torn off. Suddenly you 
notice someone sitting in this strange desert all alone, staring at the 
great unknown.

You open your eyes again, and you find yourself not far away from the 
energy field which you pass quite some time ago. You are still standing on 
the same mountain path in Mount Koldoir. You look around and found a small 
hut to your south.

When you step into the small hut, a force seals the path which leads you to

In a Vortex~
You find yourself in the center of a bright force field. As you look 
around, you see total darkness beyond this force field, as if this is a 
prison for "light". As you try to move, you feel that your feet is not 
touching anything and yet you do not feel like you are floating, or 
sitting, or in any kind of position.
