{308}
The Domain of Order is an earthly realm of the God Order.  No one seems to
know how this sacred place could be reached, as the last time a mortal set
foot there from this realm was close to 400 years ago.  Bards still sing of
the greatness of the masters that teach there, as Lord Order searched the
realm far and wide to select those to teach Her arts.

This area is originally from Hupsterman, written in 1995.  Me (Picard)
was asked to bring it into MR readyness some time in 1997.

Thanks go out to Hupsterman for getting started in coding this, to of
course the real Lord Order for inspiration, Lord Chaos for his time on
improving the Mud, Lovely Lady Maytrim for her complete understanding of
listening to me whine, my Clan Subang for listening to me whine (notice
a pattern of whining here?), and all others for their help and ideas.

  Thanks all, and enjoy.

  Picard, August 29th, 1998.

The Masters that Order selected to teach his Sacred Arts are known to have the
strongest power in all the land.  Each has something they can teach those
willing to listen.  In addition, the Lord will probably reward his loyal
servants, and punish those who soil his Domain.

There are a few quests in Order's Domain.  None are obvious and require an
adventurer to make full use of their skills of observation and exploration.

{308}
Order's Domain was founded as a sanctuary for all Order followers.  Here they
could become closer to their Goddess, as well as learn more about Her.
Unfortunately, during the massive upheaval caused by the Earth and Fire wars,
all contact seems to have been lost with the Domain.  Some still maintain that
the secret entrance can be found in the ancient songs of the bards, however,
most feel this is idle speculation.

sculpture statue~
a sculpture~
A beautiful sculpture is centered in the room here.~
The statue is over 7 foot tall and created from solid gold.  It depicts a
youthful man resting one foot upon a severed head.  In one hand the man holds
a scythe; in the other, a small pouch.  The head is tilted sideways just a bit,
ruining the perfect symmetry of the statue.

head~
The hair looks to be long, with several thick braids in itself.  The mouth,
hanging agape, is scarred along the left side.  The eyes are shut in death,
a small coin placed against them.  There is a small plaque at the very base of
the neck.

The workmanship in this statue approaches lifelike quality.  Even the pores
of this great man are preserved in striking detail.  His arm is poised to
drive a deathly blow to a Fire follower, subjugated at his feet.  In his
hand lies the mighty GodSlayer, rumoured to have once been inches from the
vile Lord Chaos's throat.

As you stare at the cube, your eyes begin to defocus, and you find it hard to

constant.  It is as if the cube is constantly expanding along all 6 sides, but
shrinking smaller while it does so.

Slowly the surroundings fade in as the personal sigil pass of Lord Order grows
cold.  The walls are the purest white you have ever witnessed; the floor, the
most stunning white marble; the lights the brightest white.  You find yourself
thinking shamefully of your past actions, but knowing that somehow it will all
turn out correct in the end.  Reason and Order slowly seeps into your mind,
and you fear not what you did a moment ago.  You know that the pure of heart,
pure of mind, and pure of soul will fear nothing here.  A small plaque, made
from white gold, is nestled snugly into the wall to your left.

Hallway~
As you stroll along the white marbled hallway, your mind slowly winds down
from the troubles that have made themselves felt.  There is beautiful,
peaceful music echoing softly through these hallways.  Try as you might to
find something out of disorder, no matter where you glance there is not even
a speck of dust that seems out of place.  Everything has it's place.  Order is
everywhere.

You are in a room lined with couches and pillows.  Trays of food and wine are

of your stomach is making itself felt more strongly than before.  It would be
logical to seek out the maid and ask if she could serve you some refreshments.
More of the hallway can be seen to the east, an open doorway into the gardens
around the Domain to the north, and the way that you entered this Realm is

A darkened ballroom~
Here, the white marbled walls are not as well lit as the others in the hall.
Torches placed around the room cast an eerie glow on the walls.  You get the
feeling that this room was used to serve some sinister purpose.  Glancing at
some of the stains on the ground, dark maroon and black, and the scratches
that are near them, tends to confirm this may have been a ritualistic death
room for the enemies of earth.  Ghostly apparitions flicker around your

Lord Order has been known to allow those less faithful followers a chance to
follow no one, and so you surmise this is what happened to this individual.

A secluded alcove~
The stench in this room assaults your nose at an unbelievable pace, you can
hardly keep your stomach under control.  All those dark stains you saw on the
ground outside obviously came from one (or more) source, and most of it is
lying here on the ground, partially decayed.  You can still see the faint
glow of the eternal fire of the Fire follower on the half rotted corpse, it's
color as red as the blood around it.  The apparitions you thought you really
hadn't seen outside seem to be clustering around the body in the center of
the room, all their hatred directed toward the rotting corpse.

You gape in awe as you walk into this spacious room:  There is no ceiling to
speak of, only a white unending void of bright light.  Everywhere you look
seems to radiate peace, with no scent of trouble or suffering seen.  At your
feet is a small altar to Lord Order.  The marketplace to the east seems very
busy, people caught up in haggling over prices and having a joyous time, but
the serene peace of this room is unaffected, and all that pass through pay
homage to Lord Order's servant.

curious looking weapon laid out on the table in the middle of the room, it
appears to have been disassembled for repair.  The blades, of which there are
three, seem to be spring loaded.  You get the feeling this isn't a weapon

tahg~
Actually, the weapon is called a d'k tahg, and was used in the assassination
of several prominent members of Lord Chaos's priesthood.  In principle, the
weapon would be stabbed past any armor the victim was wearing, into the soft
flesh.  Then, when the wielder withdrew his hand, the two addition blades
would spring open, locking the weapon into the victims body.  Should the
victim try to fight the weapon and remove it, they would eviscerate themselves.

I'm sure the guild master would love to have this one repaired.

Walking into the room softly is your only option, as everything is padded in

chosen by Lord Order.  This man must be the most powerful sorcerer in the

The blinding white light fills this room bathing everything in a brilliant

A small cup collects the blood dripping from the many hideous wounds, which
is then fed into the fountain, feeding it's nourishing strength.

An open meadow~
Your first guess was correct!  This field stretches in all directions, and is
covered in the most beautiful wild flowers your eyes have ever seen.  All
colors of the rainbow are represented, and the patches of brilliant color
swirl as the morning breeze stirs past them.  There is not a cloud to be seen
in the radiant blue sky.

The trunks of the trees here show incredible age, pock-marked and covered in
moss, and reach into the sky like a thousand needles.  There is no light
coming through the tree canopy, hundreds of feet above you, and the ground is
bare of plants and animals.  The smell of humus is strong in the air.

Tall trees are preventing much of the light of the brilliant sun from reaching

underfoot.  Small mushrooms grow out from under fallen tree limbs, thriving on
the low lighting and the rich soil.

Small blackened circles of extinguished charcoal fires litter the rutted
ground.  The gypsies are careful not to approach too near the muddied and
burnt ground, so that their clothing isn't soiled.  Their bright colored cloth
swirls in an endless artistic vision with every step.  Children, being
children. chase each other, play in the dead fires, and generally make a

A hallway~
Bustling activity greets your arrival.  Cowled forms walk each way in front of
you, oblivious to your prescence.  Looking deeply into their hoods, you can see
nothing.

A busy hallway~
A sense of unease permeates your soul as you enter this room.  Everything is in
place, a spotless carpet surrounded by flawless tapestries.  A small desk sits
perfectly centered in the room, with two piles of papers.  Each tapestry
depicts different areas of the realm, at different times.

A small dome~
Here several hooded shapes move quietly through your peripheral vision.  A
stately man is seated at the desk, piled under several layers of parchment.
Watching you discretely, he motions you closer.

Hooded figures gather around a small altar in the center of the room.  The
walls are a pale gold, adorned with white marble and silver figurines.
A soft murmur of masculine voices encompass the room.

A stairwell~
There is a spiraling staircase in the exact center of the room.  A pair of
white armoured guards stand menacingly at the lowest steps.  The sound of a
shoe scraping upon marbled floors draws your attention.  Suddenly, a man not
there before steps in front of you.  An aura of power radiates from him.

Sacred hallways of Order~
As you walk along these ornate hallways, your footsteps are swallowed as soon
as they are made.  A feeling of intense power radiates from the corridor to
the south.  A series of small, flickering torches cast dancing shadows on the
walls of the chamber.

The outer Chambers of Order~
The hallway terminates into a series of circular archways, which span the
entire length of the room.  Inscribed within each arch is a historic battle
between the armies of Order and the forces of Darkness.  In each depiction,
a shimmering shape pulses before the leaders, guiding them to destiny.  A
small plaque is at the floor board of each wall.

E
plaque~
Carefully etched in gold is the following:
In harmony all shall prosper
Order guides all of our paths
The bodies of our enemies shall be vanquished for thee

Gilikak, spoken in 109 Anno Dominae

The outer Chambers of Order~
As you approach the most inner series of arches, the radiating power is almost
palpable.  Every breath you take swells your chest with the thunderous might
of a God still believed in and worshipped.  There can be only one Lord Order.

The Sacred inner Chamber of Order~
Words can not describe the blessed splendor radiating from the man in front of
you.  Everything is bathed in a pure white light.  Nothing evil can lurk here,
and all your crimes are exposed by the power of Order.

BuBBle~
This BuBBle in the Space-Time continium floats just outside of our earth.
Shimmering shapes of different realities drift through your vision like a
small storm tossed ship, adrift.
