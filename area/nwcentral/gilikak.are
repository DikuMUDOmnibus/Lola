jocelyn lady~
Lady Jocelyn~
A young lady wanders aimlessly with a look of regret and sorrow upon her face.~
You see a young woman of pristine beauty.  She is wearing an ivory white
satin dress.  She fills the small dress with ample but petite curves.  Her
raven black hair flows down the middle of her back, contrasting her pale skin.
Deep sorrow and pain is evident within the hollows of her crystal blue eyes.

painting~
The huge mural depicts a large man shining brilliantly in the late day sun.

His gleaming white armor smeared with the blood of his enemies.  His head
is held high, and his square chin is stuck out in challenge to an unknown
foe.  A mass of people filter through the wake of carnage behind him as he
 
gallantly stands his ground.  His sword, bearing the crest of Order, is
raised high covered in the gore of the minions he has slaughtered.  A dark
mass of seething, chaotic clouds throws fireballs to the ground.

Looking undaunted he waves the fleeing people to safety.

A few moth holes line the corner of the picture where it is evident they have eaten away at the once rich textile.  As you look closer at the portrait you
see that it is a mass sacrifice of a few austere men in agonizing pain.  If
you squint you can almost make out their faces.
